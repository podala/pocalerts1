I want to present business usecase on llm and importance .usecase excel formula conversion to pyspatk code.befenits and we have less resources who knows the python.we have complex formula this is difficult to understand . Another use case we rag framework since we are having more formulas and how this are converted to python i meam business logic in around this .another usecase is chat on data on sql data and skso convert thise things to graphs accordingly which help underwriter group with out writing the querying etc . Please create usecase.  I need you to mention some points under each use case

Here’s a structured Business Use Case Presentation on leveraging LLMs (Large Language Models) for accelerating PBM and healthcare underwriting workflows. The focus is on solving real bottlenecks — formula complexity, resource limitations, and user-friendly data access — using intelligent LLM agents.

📌 Title: Leveraging LLMs for PBM Underwriting: Smart Agents for Formula Conversion, Business Rule Extraction, and SQL-Free Insights
✅ Problem Context
PBM underwriting teams deal with:

Thousands of Excel-based pricing and rebate formulas

Sparse Python expertise among domain SMEs

The need for on-demand simulation and data-driven decisions without SQL/code

Growing backlog due to complex manual translations of logic to production-ready code

🧠 Use Case 1: Excel Formula → PySpark Code Conversion via LLM Agents
🔍 Business Problem:
Excel files contain deeply nested formulas with cross-sheet references (e.g., IF, INDEX/MATCH, LOOKUP logic).

Translating these formulas to Python/PySpark manually takes weeks and requires deep domain + coding skill.

Non-technical actuaries or underwriters can't debug or validate the logic.

🤖 LLM-Driven Solution:
Use LLM Agent 1 to parse and explain Excel formulas in business English with traceability.

Use LLM Agent 2 to convert formulas to PySpark logic (e.g., UDFs, column-level expressions).

Validate PySpark outputs row-by-row against Excel values.

💡 Benefits:
Reduces formula conversion time from weeks to hours

Bridges gap between Excel users and engineers

Ensures transparency and reproducibility

Enables non-programmers to validate logic before production

📚 Use Case 2: Business Logic Packaging Using RAG Framework (LLM + Vector Search)
🔍 Business Problem:
Dozens of drug pricing formulas and modifiers (e.g., Step %, W/GF) exist across documents, spreadsheets, and emails.

Teams struggle to keep track of which logic applies when, and how it maps to Python code or YAML rulesets.

🤖 LLM + RAG Solution:
Index all formula documents, Excel sheets, and YAML configs using a vector database.

Ask natural language queries like:
“What’s the logic behind WAC adjustment for Specialty channel in 2026?”

Automatically generate code-ready YAML or PySpark snippets by retrieving and synthesizing rules.

💡 Benefits:
Turns unstructured formula logic into traceable digital assets

Helps underwriters and developers instantly retrieve correct business rules

Reduces dependency on SMEs and tribal knowledge

Supports auditable, explainable AI

💬 Use Case 3: Conversational Analytics on SQL Data with Chart/Graph Generation
🔍 Business Problem:
Underwriters need to explore trends (e.g., AWP inflation, utilization rates) but don’t know SQL.

Business insights depend on engineers writing queries and creating charts manually.

🤖 LLM Chat + Chart Generation Solution:
Allow underwriters to chat with the data:
"Show me the 2025 average AWP trend by channel."

LLM converts prompt → SQL → executes → generates a chart (e.g., bar/line).

Optionally, explain the SQL logic for transparency.

💡 Benefits:
Empowers business users to explore data visually, without writing queries

Reduces turn-around time for insight generation

Increases adoption of data-driven workflows

Bridges the gap between data lake and decision making
