Heartfelt Thanks as I Transition to a New Chapter as Senior Architect

Dear Team,

As I prepare to move to a new chapter in my career as a Senior Architect, I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude to all of you for the incredible support and guidance you’ve provided me during my time here.

I would like to extend a special thank you to Srini Karnti, Mamatha, and Melissa for your unwavering support throughout my journey in Behavioral Health (BH). Your leadership and encouragement have been invaluable to me.

In Care Management (CM), a big thank you to Sharon and the entire engineering leadership team for your mentorship and collaboration. Working with you has been an enriching experience, and I am grateful for the opportunities to grow and learn under your guidance.

To the product team, I’d like to give a special shout-out to Mohit, Brandy, and the other product owners. Your insights and collaboration as colleagues have made a significant impact, and I’ve truly enjoyed being part of the projects we worked on together.

To the architecture team, my sincere thanks go to Venkata and Sheela. Your support and guidance have been instrumental, and I appreciate all the help you’ve provided along the way.

To the reporting team, my sincere thanks go to Gopi, Srividya, and your fantastic team. Your dedication and hard work have been truly inspiring, and I’ve appreciated every moment of working together.

I’m also going to miss our Practice Manager and Care Plan teams dearly. It has been a pleasure working with you all, but please know that you can reach out to me at any time.

Thank you all for making my time here so rewarding. I’m excited about the new challenges ahead but will always cherish the experiences and friendships I’ve gained here.
