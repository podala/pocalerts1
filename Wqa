3. API Design
Authentication API (User Management)

POST /api/auth/register 
POST /api/auth/login 
GET  /api/auth/userinfo 
POST /api/auth/logout

GET  /api/assumptions            # List all assumptions
POST /api/assumptions            # Create new assumption
GET  /api/assumptions/{id}       # Fetch single assumption
PUT  /api/assumptions/{id}       # Update assumption
DELETE /api/assumptions/{id}     # Delete assumption
GET  /api/assumptions/compare    # Compare two assumptions

GET  /api/notifications          # Get all notifications
POST /api/notifications/send     # Send notification
GET  /api/export/csv
GET  /api/export/excel
GET  /api/export/json

5. React.js UI Features
Dashboard: Show assumption status, recent updates, notifications
Data Entry Forms: Add, update, and confirm assumptions
Comparison View: Side-by-side assumption comparison
Role-Based Access Control: Different access levels for Actuaries, Stakeholders, and Admins
Real-time Updates: WebSockets to notify users on assumption changes
Data Export: Users can download assumptions in CSV, Excel, or JSON format

6. Event-Driven Architecture using Kafka
Topic Name	Producer	Consumer	Event Description
assumption.updated	Assumption Service	Notification Service, Export Service	Notify stakeholders when an assumption is updated
assumption.compared	Assumption Service	Actuary Service	Trigger variance reports
assumption.approved	Stakeholder UI	Notification Service	Notify actuaries when assumption is confirmed
export.generated	Export Service	User Management, Email Service	Notify users when export is ready

Assumptions Table (SQL)
CREATE TABLE assumptions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    effective_date DATE,
    assumption_end_date DATE,
    production_effective_date DATE,
    production_end_date DATE,
    updated_by VARCHAR(255),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
Stakeholder Assumption Changes (MongoDB)
{
    "_id": "12345",
    "assumptionId": "9876",
    "stakeholder": "John Doe",
    "changes": [
        {
            "field": "effective_date",
            "oldValue": "2025-01-01",
            "newValue": "2025-02-01"
        }

Rate Limiting using Redis
API Gateway (Kong / Nginx)
Data Encryption (TLS 1.3, AES-256)
Audit Logging (Kafka + MongoDB)
8. Deployment & Scaling
Microservices on Kubernetes (Azure AKS / AWS EKS)
PostgreSQL + Read Replicas for scaling
MongoDB Sharding for large-scale assumptions
Kafka partitions for event scaling
Elasticsearch indexing for full-text search
GraphQL Query Optimization using DataLoader
9. CI/CD Pipeline
Stage	Tool	Description
Code Build	GitHub Actions	Runs unit tests & builds the app
Containerization	Docker	Creates images for microservices
Deployment	Kubernetes (K8s)	Deploys containers in production
Monitoring	Prometheus + Grafana	Observability & Performance Metrics
10. Next Steps
Create Git Repository for Frontend, Backend, and Infrastructure
Set up Docker & Kubernetes environment
Develop React UI for managing assumptions
Implement Spring Boot APIs with GraphQL
Set up Kafka Topics for real-time events
