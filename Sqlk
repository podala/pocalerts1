Enterprise-Level Data Model for Change Tracking & Reconciliation
To build a scalable and future-proof enterprise data model, we need a design that ensures:

Efficient change tracking with versioning.
Auditability of all underwriter changes.
Seamless reconciliation between changes and file uploads.
Support for future expansions (e.g., new data sources, workflows, real-time processing).
1️⃣ Enterprise-Level Data Model
We will design three core tables:

Change Log Table (change_log) → Tracks underwriter changes with versioning.
File Upload Tracking Table (file_uploads) → Tracks when the original file is uploaded.
Reconciliation Status Table (reconciliation_status) → Helps track delayed uploads and provides a centralized view for business users.
📌 change_log (Captures Updates & Versions)
Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	BIGINT (PK)	Auto-increment primary key
plid	VARCHAR(50)	Unique identifier for PL
opportunity_id	VARCHAR(50)	Opportunity ID
case_id	VARCHAR(50)	Case ID
quote_id	VARCHAR(50)	Quote ID
client_name	VARCHAR(255)	Client name
business_segment	VARCHAR(100)	Business segment
base_version	VARCHAR(50)	Initial base version
change_version	INT	Auto-incremented version (1,2,3...)
change_type	VARCHAR(50)	(INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
change_timestamp	DATETIME	When the change was made
changed_by	VARCHAR(255)	Underwriter who made the change
change_source	VARCHAR(50)	UI, API, System Job, etc.
json_payload	JSON	Updated JSON data
previous_payload	JSON	Previous data before update
reconciliation_status	VARCHAR(50)	PENDING, COMPLETED, DELAYED
📌 Indexes:
✅ plid, opportunity_id, case_id, quote_id for fast lookups.
✅ change_version to track history.

📌 file_uploads (Tracks File Uploads)
Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	BIGINT (PK)	Auto-increment primary key
plid	VARCHAR(50)	PL identifier
opportunity_id	VARCHAR(50)	Opportunity ID
case_id	VARCHAR(50)	Case ID
quote_id	VARCHAR(50)	Quote ID
uploaded_by	VARCHAR(255)	Underwriter who uploaded the file
upload_timestamp	DATETIME	Timestamp of file upload
file_path	VARCHAR(500)	Path to the file
📌 Indexes:
✅ plid, opportunity_id, case_id, quote_id for fast lookup.
✅ upload_timestamp for tracking delays.

📌 reconciliation_status (Tracks Pending & Delayed Uploads)
Column Name	Data Type	Description
id	BIGINT (PK)	Auto-increment primary key
plid	VARCHAR(50)	PL identifier
opportunity_id	VARCHAR(50)	Opportunity ID
case_id	VARCHAR(50)	Case ID
quote_id	VARCHAR(50)	Quote ID
change_timestamp	DATETIME	When the change was made
days_pending	INT	Days since change
status	VARCHAR(50)	PENDING, DELAYED, RESOLVED
📌 Indexes:
✅ plid, opportunity_id, case_id, quote_id to enable reconciliation tracking.
✅ status for quick status reports.

2️⃣ Ingestion & Processing Workflow
✅ Step 1: Capture Changes
When an underwriter updates a record, insert it into change_log with:
Auto-incremented change_version
reconciliation_status = 'PENDING'
📌 SQL Query for Change Capture:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO change_log (plid, opportunity_id, case_id, quote_id, client_name, 
                        business_segment, base_version, change_version, 
                        change_type, change_timestamp, changed_by, 
                        change_source, json_payload, previous_payload, reconciliation_status)
SELECT 
    new_data.plid, new_data.opportunity_id, new_data.case_id, new_data.quote_id,
    new_data.client_name, new_data.business_segment, new_data.baseVersion,
    COALESCE((SELECT MAX(change_version) FROM change_log cl 
              WHERE cl.plid = new_data.plid 
                AND cl.opportunity_id = new_data.opportunity_id
                AND cl.case_id = new_data.case_id
                AND cl.quote_id = new_data.quote_id), 0) + 1 AS change_version,
    new_data.change_type, new_data.change_timestamp, new_data.changed_by, 
    new_data.change_source, new_data.json_payload, new_data.previous_payload,
    'PENDING'
FROM (SELECT * FROM temp_data_source) new_data;
✅ Step 2: Track File Upload
When an underwriter uploads the file, insert into file_uploads.
📌 SQL Query for File Upload Tracking:

sql
Copy
Edit
INSERT INTO file_uploads (plid, opportunity_id, case_id, quote_id, uploaded_by, upload_timestamp, file_path)
VALUES ('PL123', 'OPP456', 'CASE789', 'QUOTE100', 'Underwriter1', NOW(), '/storage/path/file.xlsx');
✅ Step 3: Reconciliation Process
Compare change_log and file_uploads
Update reconciliation_status in change_log based on file upload timing.
📌 SQL Query for Reconciliation Check:

sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE change_log cl
LEFT JOIN file_uploads fu 
ON cl.plid = fu.plid 
AND cl.opportunity_id = fu.opportunity_id 
AND cl.case_id = fu.case_id 
AND cl.quote_id = fu.quote_id
SET cl.reconciliation_status = 
    CASE 
        WHEN fu.upload_timestamp IS NOT NULL THEN 'COMPLETED' 
        WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(DAY, cl.change_timestamp, NOW()) > 5 THEN 'DELAYED'
        ELSE 'PENDING'
    END;
👉 This automatically marks records as COMPLETED, PENDING, or DELAYED.

3️⃣ Real-Time Monitoring & Automation
✅ Kafka Streaming: Stream all changes to Kafka for real-time tracking.
✅ Power BI / Grafana Dashboard: Track pending and delayed uploads.
✅ Automated Email Alerts: Send reminders to underwriters who haven't uploaded files.
📌 Python Script for Alerts:

python
Copy
Edit
import pymysql, smtplib

connection = pymysql.connect(host='db_host', user='db_user', password='db_pass', database='db_name')
query = "SELECT changed_by, opportunity_id FROM change_log WHERE reconciliation_status = 'DELAYED';"

cursor = connection.cursor()
cursor.execute(query)
delayed_uploads = cursor.fetchall()

for record in delayed_uploads:
    underwriter = record[0]
    opportunity_id = record[1]
    email_body = f"Reminder: Upload the file for Opportunity ID {opportunity_id}."
    smtplib.SMTP("smtp.yourcompany.com").sendmail("noreply@company.com", f"{underwriter}@company.com", email_body)
👉 Sends automated reminders to underwriters for delayed uploads.

4️⃣ Final Thoughts
✅ Enterprise-ready: Scalable, indexed, and optimized.
✅ Automated tracking & versioning for all changes.
✅ Supports real-time monitoring & reconciliation.
✅ Email alerts & Power BI dashboard for visibility.
