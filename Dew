Thought for 59s

Short answer: yes—this architecture is solid.
Below are the tweaks I’d make so it’s enterprise-ready, plus exact steps, model usage (SLM vs LLM vs code), payload shapes, guardrails, and self-repair.

1) End-to-end flow (who does what + model choice)

0. React UI (code)

Sends {tenant_id, app_id, session_id, user_id, chat_history_ids[], user_message}.

Token budget per turn is attached (e.g., max_input_tokens, max_output_tokens).

1) Orchestrator node

Code only fan-out tools, then consolidates state.

Tool A: normalize() → lowercase, trim, typo fix, stopwords. Code.

Tool B: intent_entities() → intents, metrics, dims, ops. SLM (cheap model).

Tool C: time_resolver() → “today/last month/FY24” → absolute ranges. Code first, fallback SLM if ambiguous.

Produces orchestrator_state → passed to Planner.

2) Planner node

Inputs: intent/entities, time_range, catalog (see §5).

Tools it calls:

list_tables() Code (DB/metadata store).

describe_table(table) Code.

sample_rows(table) Optional, Code (TOP 5 for synonyms).

Routing (SLM vs LLM):

Use SLM for simple queries (≤2 tables, no nested subqueries).

Use LLM when joins >2, window funcs, nested filters, groupings, or entity coverage < 0.7 (details in §3).

Output: plan JSON (tables, join keys, columns, filters, metrics, limits).
Also output column_pruning here (don’t wait until Solver).

3) Solver (Generate SQL)

Reads plan; fills real schema.table.column names; applies planner filters/joins.

SLM for simple SQL; LLM for complex (>3 joins, CTEs, window/rollups).

Output: candidate_sql + reasoning_map (trace to plan).

4) SQL Guardrails (pre-execute)

Code + optional SLM rewriter.

Static checks (SQLGlot/SQLFluff/AST):

Allowlist schemas/tables/functions.

Force TOP n/LIMIT n, WHERE on time if table is partitioned.

Ban DELETE/UPDATE/INSERT, cross-db links, SELECT *.

Enforce SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT (e.g., 20s).

If fail → Rewrite node (SLM) to fix lintable issues → re-check. Max 2 loops.

5) Executor

Code with a read-only DB user + timeouts.

Optionally run EXPLAIN first; reject if cost too high.

Output: rows, columns, exec_stats (duration, scanned_rows).

6) Self-repair

If DB error:

Compile-time (unknown column/table, syntax) → go back to Rewrite (SLM) with error class + plan.

Runtime (timeout, memory, cardinality) → Replan (Planner) to use aggregates/materialized views or add time filters. LLM allowed.

Retry policy: up to 2 rewrites, 1 replan.

7) Answer builder

SLM to summarize results; code to attach CSV/JSON; redact PII.

Store short-term memory & analytics (see §6).

2) What to add/change in your diagram

Push “Clean/lowercasing” and “Resolve dates” into code before any model call.

Move “Pruned columns” into Planner output (not a freestanding box).

Add a Schema Catalog (offline + online) feeding the Planner (see §5).

Make Guardrails mandatory before execution (AST allowlist + LIMIT injector).

Split self-repair into compile-time vs runtime branches.

Add caching: plan cache by normalized query + tenant.

Add observability: per-node span logs with a single trace_id.

Ensure read-only SQL role and ROWCOUNT/LIMIT, STATEMENT_TIMEOUT.

Add Answer builder step (formatting + citations to tables/columns used).

Put an explicit model router (policy in §3).

3) SLM ↔ LLM routing policy (simple, deterministic)

Compute a complexity score in Planner:

tables_predicted: 1–N

joins_predicted: count of join edges

ops: presence of group by, window, subquery, case when

coverage: fraction of entities mapped to real columns (0–1)

time_filter: present? (bool)

est_rows: from stats or heuristics by partition size

Route to SLM if ALL true:

tables_predicted ≤ 2

joins_predicted ≤ 2

ops excludes window/subqueries

coverage ≥ 0.7

time_filter == true

Else → LLM.

Also up-route to LLM when prior turn failed or when user asks for “breakdown by month + top N per group” (window/CTE).

4) Payload shapes (copy-paste ready)

(a) Orchestrator → Planner

{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "tenant_id": "acme",
  "app_id": "chat-sql",
  "session_id": "user:123:session:abc",
  "message_id": "turn-42",
  "user_message": "count of members whose contract is active and address from bangalore",
  "intent": "aggregate_count",
  "entities": {
    "metric": "member_count",
    "filters": [{"field":"address_city","op":"eq","value":"Bengaluru"},
                {"field":"contract_status","op":"eq","value":"Active"}]
  },
  "time_range": {"from": "2025-09-01", "to": "2025-09-04", "granularity": null},
  "token_budget": {"input": 6000, "output": 512}
}


(b) Planner → Solver

{
  "plan_id": "uuid",
  "tables": ["dim_member", "fact_contract"],
  "joins": [{"left":"fact_contract.member_id","right":"dim_member.member_id","type":"inner"}],
  "columns_needed": ["dim_member.member_id"],
  "filters": [{"table":"dim_member","column":"city","op":"=","value":"Bengaluru"},
              {"table":"fact_contract","column":"status","op":"=","value":"Active"}],
  "aggregations": [{"op":"count_distinct","column":"dim_member.member_id","alias":"member_count"}],
  "limits": 0,
  "complexity_score": 0.32,
  "route": "SLM"
}


(c) Solver → Guardrails

{
  "sql": "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dm.member_id) AS member_count
          FROM fact_contract fc
          JOIN dim_member dm ON dm.member_id = fc.member_id
          WHERE dm.city = 'Bengaluru' AND fc.status = 'Active';",
  "reasoning_map": {"filters_from_entities": true, "join_from_catalog": "member_id"}
}


(d) Guardrails → Executor

{
  "sql_checked": "/*trace:uuid*/ SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT dm.member_id) AS member_count
                  FROM fact_contract fc
                  JOIN dim_member dm ON dm.member_id = fc.member_id
                  WHERE dm.city = 'Bengaluru' AND fc.status = 'Active'
                  LIMIT 100000;",
  "checks": {"ast_ok": true, "allowlist_ok": true, "limit_injected": true}
}


(e) Error → Self-repair

{
  "error_class": "UnknownColumn",
  "db_message": "column dm.city does not exist",
  "candidate_sql": "...",
  "plan": {...},
  "catalog_hints": [{"table":"dim_member","closest_columns":["city_name","city_code"]}]
}

5) Schema Catalog (backbone for Planner)

Maintain a catalog service (Azure SQL/Blob + cache) with:

Tables, columns, PK/FK, stats (rowcount, partitions, date columns).

Business dictionary: synonyms → columns (e.g., “active contract” → status='Active').

Join graph: recommended join paths.

Materialized/aggregate tables for runtime swap when queries are heavy.
Populate offline; refresh daily; in memory via Redis for low latency.

6) Memory, logging, and cost control

Short-term memory (per chat): Redis keys chat:{tenant}:{session} → recent turns, plan ids, chosen routes, last SQL. Rolling summary built with SLM to cap tokens.

Long-term memory: Azure Table/SQL:

Saved queries, user column aliases (“city = city_name”), user preferences (units, locale).

Intent → table mappings learned from accepted answers.

Observability: Azure Monitor / App Insights

One trace_id per turn. Spans: orchestrator, planner, solver, guardrails, execute, repair.

Log token usage per node, latency, retries, model name, route decision.

Redact PII before logging.

Cost control:

Strict token budgets per node; truncate chat with rolling summaries.

Prefer SLM (e.g., gpt-4o-mini) by default; escalate via router.

Cache: normalized user query → plan/sql for hot intents.

7) Guardrails & self-repair details

Static guardrails (pre-exec):

AST parse → reject DDL/DML.

Enforce schema/table/func allowlist.

Inject LIMIT/TOP and time filter if table has a partition column.

Ban SELECT *; replace with pruned columns from plan.

Optional SLM Rewriter to fix column typos to nearest catalog match.

Runtime repair:

Syntax/unknown id → Rewriter with catalog hints (SLM).

Timeout/oom → Planner swaps to aggregates, adds partition predicates, reduces DISTINCT, or stages with CTE then aggregate. May escalate to LLM.

8) “Nice to have” (you asked for these)

Confidence + citation card: show which tables/columns and why; score bar.

Saved query gallery per tenant with approval flags.

Row-level privacy filters auto-injected from user claims (RBAC).

Prompt eval harness with golden questions (nightly) to track accuracy.

Cold start warmup: pre-load catalog in Redis on app boot.

9) Quick example on your sample question

“count of members whose contract is active and address from bangalore”

Orchestrator: intent=aggregate_count, entities={member, active, city=Bengaluru}. SLM

Planner: picks dim_member, fact_contract; join on member_id; prunes to member_id. SLM route

Solver: generates SQL shown above. SLM

Guardrails: injects LIMIT, passes allowlist. Code

Executor: runs read-only; returns [{member_count: 12453}]. Code

Answer: “12,453 members…” + “used tables: dim_member, fact_contract” + CSV button. SLM summary

10) Implementation map (LangGraph)

Nodes: orchestrator → planner → solver → guardrails → executor → answer with edges to rewrite and replan on failure.
Bind tools: list_tables, describe_t
