Updated Sequence Diagram with Error Handling
This updated diagram includes failure scenarios and their handling mechanisms:

ðŸ”¹ Main Flow:
Producer System (UI / Batch) generates an event.
The event is published to Azure Event Hub (Kafka API).
Kafka Consumer (Spring Boot Application) consumes the event.
The Event Processing Service processes the event.
The processed data is stored in CosmosDB or another storage.
The UI / Dashboard fetches processed data for display.
ðŸ”¹ Error Handling Scenarios:
Event Hub Failure â†’ Retry mechanism or move to Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
Kafka Consumer Failure â†’ Retry logic, and if still failing, move to DLQ.
Event Processing Error â†’ Logged and alerted for debugging.
Data Storage Failure â†’ Logged and alerted to prevent data loss.
This ensures resilient event processing by implementing retry mechanisms, DLQ, and logging alerts.

Handling Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) in Azure Event Hub with Kafka Consumer
Dead Letter Queues (DLQ) are used to handle messages that cannot be processed due to errors such as:

Message format issues
Schema mismatches
Processing failures
Expired events (TTL exceeded)
Consumer failures (e.g., application crash)
ðŸ”¹ How DLQ Works in Azure Event Hub
Event Hub does NOT provide an automatic DLQ like Azure Service Bus.
You need to manually configure DLQ handling in your Kafka consumer (Spring Boot Application).
A separate Event Hub or Storage Account is recommended for DLQ messages.
