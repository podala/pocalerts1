Verification of GraphQL Queries for Performance Assurance

Objective: To ensure that GraphQL queries do not introduce or exacerbate performance issues in the system.

Process:

Initial Review:

1.1 Gathered all GraphQL queries used across the system.
1.2 Conducted a preliminary analysis to pinpoint potential areas of performance concern.
Collaboration with the Data Team:

2.1 Shared the queries with the data team for a deeper evaluation.
2.2 Jointly reviewed query structures, focusing on potential inefficiencies and data retrieval patterns.
2.3 Assessed the queries in terms of database indexing, potential over-fetching or under-fetching of data, and nested query impact.
Performance Testing:

3.1 Simulated high-load scenarios to test the performance of the GraphQL queries.
3.2 Monitored response times, server load, and database operations during the tests.
Feedback and Optimization:

4.1 Gathered feedback from the data team regarding any identified inefficiencies.
4.2 Made necessary optimizations to the queries to ensure optimal performance.
4.3 Reran performance tests to validate the improvements.
Confirmation:

5.1 Based on the combined insights from the reviews and tests, confirmed that the GraphQL queries have no adverse impact on performance.
Outcome: All GraphQL queries were verified in collaboration with the data team, and it was confirmed that they do not contribute to performance issues in the system.
