## 💼 **Job Title:** Azure OpenAI Engineer – Databricks, RAG & Agentic Systems

**Location:** Bengaluru / Hybrid
**Experience:** 6 – 12 years
**Employment Type:** Full-time

---

### 🧠 **About the Role**

Join our AI Center of Excellence to build production-grade **LLM solutions on Azure**, integrating **Databricks, RAG, agent-to-agent orchestration**, and **MCP-based tool ecosystems**.
You’ll design intelligent multi-agent systems, connect enterprise data through RAG pipelines, and ship secure, observable, and cost-efficient AI services.

### ⚙️ **Key Responsibilities**

* **Agentic Architecture:** Design planner → solver → verifier and supervisor graphs; implement agent-to-agent communication, memory sharing, and context handoff.
* **MCP Integration:** Develop and register **Model Context Protocol servers/clients**; expose Azure, SQL, and API systems as MCP tools with versioning and auth.
* **RAG Pipelines:** Build retrieval layers using **Azure AI Search, Cosmos DB Vector Index, and Databricks Delta Tables**; optimize chunking, metadata, and reranking.
* **Azure OpenAI Services:** Use GPT-4 Turbo/5, Embeddings v3, and function calling for reasoning and tool use. Leverage Prompt Flow and Azure AI Studio for LLMOps.
* **Databricks Integration:** Orchestrate data pipelines, feature stores, and batch/streaming jobs feeding LLM retrieval layers. Automate data preparation and monitoring.
* **Backend Services:** Develop FastAPI/Flask microservices integrating LLM logic; deploy via Azure Functions, App Service, or AKS.
* **Observability & Safety:** Implement guardrails (PII filters, content policies), logging, trace spans, and cost/latency telemetry (Application Insights + LangSmith).
* **Collaboration:** Work with data engineering and cloud teams to enable secure, governed, multi-tenant AI deployments.
