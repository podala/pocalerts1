1. Cost Considerations
Component	Cost Estimate	Details
Azure VM Maintenance	$50 - $200/month (depending on size)	VMs are still required to pull files from the new upload folder from the on-prem NAS drive to Azure.
Azure Blob Storage for CSV Files	$0.0184 per GB/month	Storage for CSV files in Azure. The cost is minimal, depending on file size and retention.
Azure Data Pipeline (ADF/Spark)	$1 per 1,000 activity runs	Costs associated with running data ingestion pipelines. Spark processing will incur costs based on the cluster size and duration.
Development Effort (One-time)	$5,000 - $8,000	Initial development cost for setting up the new CSV process, removing the CatLog file, and integrating with the Azure pipeline.
Maintenance Cost (Annual)	$1,000 - $2,000	Ongoing system monitoring and minor updates.
2. Benefits Analysis
Benefit	Estimated Savings / Improvement	Details
Reduced VM Issues	15-20% reduction in system downtime	Removing the CatLog file minimizes VM-related problems, leading to improved system stability.
Faster Data Pipeline Execution	25-30% improvement in pipeline performance	Spark Fireworks POC shows that processing is faster and more efficient, reducing overall processing time.
Improved Underwriter Experience	Indirect savings through efficiency	No negative impact on the underwriter experience, ensuring smooth operations without additional training or adjustments.
Lower Storage & Processing Costs	$3,000 - $5,000 annually	Moving from on-prem to Azure reduces storage and processing costs over time.
Operational Efficiency	Saves ~10-15 hours/week in manual work	Simplifying the process reduces manual interventions and increases productivity.
3. ROI Calculation
Total Estimated Cost (Year 1): ~$7,000 - $10,000 (development + operational costs)
Total Annual Savings: ~$10,000 - $15,000
ROI (Return on Investment) = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100

(12,500−8,500)/8,500×100=47% ROI within the first year.
Business Benefits:
Enhanced Pipeline Performance:

The Spark Fireworks POC demonstrates faster data processing, improving pipeline efficiency.
Reduced Operational Overhead:

Removing the CatLog file minimizes VM-related issues and reduces maintenance requirements.
Cost Savings:

Transitioning from on-prem to Azure reduces long-term infrastructure and maintenance costs.
Scalability:

The new process is better suited for future scaling, as Azure can handle increasing data volumes more effectively.
Stable Underwriter Workflow:

No disruption to underwriter activities ensures that business operations remain smooth and consistent.
Conclusion:
✅ ROI of ~47% in the first year, with increasing savings in subsequent years.
✅ Pipeline efficiency improved significantly due to the POC on Spark Fireworks.
✅ Lower operational costs and reduced system issues with the removal of the CatLog file.

Recommendation: Proceed with the new process as the long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs, and operational efficiency will improve significantly.
