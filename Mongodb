.qupuery Time and Access Pattern in MongoDB Atlas Layers
MongoDB Atlas Layer	Query Type	Is Data Online?	Typical Latency	When to Use	Notes
1. Cluster Storage (Hot Layer)	Full CRUD, Aggregation, Realtime API	✅ Yes	50 ms – 5 sec	All active data, dashboards, apps	Fastest access, supports indexes, in-memory cache
2. Online Archive (Cold Layer)	Read-only via Atlas SQL / Federated Queries	✅ Yes	1 – 10 sec	For cold data (older than 30/60 days), infrequent access	Data is stored in S3/Blob internally, format is Parquet
3. Data Federation on External S3/Blob	Read-only	✅ Yes	5 – 20 sec	Query external lakes, CSV/Parquet in object stores	You register your own bucket; no Mongo ingest needed
4. Queryable Backup Snapshot	Read-only (no indexes)	✅ On-demand (cold start)	30 sec – 2 min	Forensics, point-in-time investigation	Not meant for production querying; snapshot mounted temporarily
5. Cloud Backup (Coldest)	No queries — restore only	❌ Offline	Minutes to Hours (restore time)	DR/Recovery only	Can't query directly; requires full restore to cluster

🕒 Example Query Latency (for 150M records ~50 GB)
Query Type	Hot Layer (Cluster)	Online Archive	Federation (S3)	Queryable Backup
find({clientId}) (index hit)	< 100 ms	1–2 sec	2–3 sec	~30 sec (cold spin)
$match + $group (10-day range)	1–2 sec	3–6 sec	8–15 sec	1–2 min
Full scan (1-year)	15–30 sec	30–60 sec	60–120 sec	3–5 min

When to Use Each Layer
Need	Use This Layer
Real-time apps, dashboards	Hot Layer (Cluster)
Archived data, rarely accessed but still queryable	Online Archive
Query CSV/Parquet/JSON from cloud buckets	Federation Layer
Point-in-time restore or rare snapshot browsing	Queryable Backup
Backup-only, no query support	Cloud Backup
