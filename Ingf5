Voyage AI Models — Overview
🔹 1. Text Embedding Models

These convert text into vector representations that capture semantic meaning. They differ by quality, latency, and cost.

Model	Context Length	Primary Use
voyage-4-large	~32,000 tokens	Best general-purpose retrieval quality
voyage-4	~32,000 tokens	Balanced quality/performance
voyage-4-lite	~32,000 tokens	Lower latency & lower cost
Domain-specific models (e.g., voyage-code-3, voyage-finance-2, etc.)	~32,000 tokens	Specialized domains where semantics differ (e.g., code, finance)

➡️ These models produce vector embeddings you store in MongoDB Vector Search. Larger context lengths let you embed longer text chunks.

Contextualized Chunk Embedding Model

voyage-context-3

Designed to produce chunk embeddings that also encode global document context — not just the local chunk text.

This helps retrieval quality in multi-section or complex documents (since the vector captures surrounding context without needing overlapping chunks).

👉 Recommended when:
✔ You want better retrieval quality without heavy overlap between chunks
✔ You are working with long structured documents (reports, contracts, RFPs)
✔ You’re building RAG applications over large corpora

Multimodal Embeddings

voyage-multimodal-3.5 (and older voyage-multimodal-3)

Embeds interleaved text + images + video (e.g., screenshots, slide decks with visuals), all into a unified vector space.

Useful when your corpus is not just text — such as marketing decks, scanned docs, figures in PDFs, etc.
