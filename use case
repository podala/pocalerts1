Use Case: Simplifying User Interactions in an Enterprise Application
Overview
The goal is to develop an AI-powered interface that uses NLP to understand and execute user commands from a simple text input. This interface will replace several existing components of the UI, reducing complexity and improving usability.

Actors
End Users: Regular users who interact with the application to manage teams and perform bulk operations.
System Administrators: Admins who monitor and configure the backend processes.
NLP System: The AI/ML component that processes user inputs and executes commands.
Preconditions
The user is authenticated and authorized to perform the actions.
The NLP system is properly integrated with the existing backend systems to perform the actions.
Adequate training data has been provided to the NLP model to understand and execute the range of commands accurately.
Basic Flow
User Input:

The user accesses a single text input interface.
The user types a command, such as "Create a new team with John, Alice, and Bob" or "Transfer 100 members to team Delta."
Command Interpretation:

The input text is sent to the NLP system.
The NLP system uses trained models to interpret the intent and entities within the command (e.g., action type, user names, team names, numbers).
Action Execution:

Based on the interpreted intent and entities, the system performs the necessary backend actions, such as creating a team or transferring members.
The system confirms the execution of the command or asks for further clarification if the intent is not clear.
Feedback:

Upon successful execution, a confirmation message is displayed to the user.
If the action cannot be completed, an error message is shown, explaining the issue.
