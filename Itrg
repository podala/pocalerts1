Rebate Prediction & Net Cost Calculation
Model Type: Predictive Modeling
Approach:
Build a model to predict rebates at a granular level using historical rebate patterns and channel-specific data (retail 30, 90, mail order).
Use clustering algorithms (like K-Means) to group similar drugs and predict likely rebate structures when PBMs don't provide specific rebate data.
Net Pricing Calculation:
Automate the calculation of net cost per script and overall net discount using AI-driven formulas.
Predict how changes in rebates affect month-to-month drug spend and long-term savings.
