Enhanced Idea Summary
Pulse Analyst – A data intelligence platform that identifies data quality issues, such as missing values, format discrepancies, duplicates, and inconsistent patterns in employee data. This tool leverages LLMs for advanced anomaly detection, dynamic issue classification, and automated suggestions for improvement while providing analysts with data-driven insights for reporting and decision-making.

The system provides:

End-to-end validation: Detects missing data, formatting issues, and logical inconsistencies.
Root cause analysis: Uses LLMs to explain why issues occur and how they impact business processes.
Self-repair suggestions: Fix common issues like formatting mismatches, missing prefixes, or duplicates.
Advanced analytics: Generates reports on trends, patterns, and actionable KPIs for HR and payroll systems.
Interactive querying: Enables analysts to ask natural language questions and receive actionable insights or visualizations.
Solution Summary
Data Quality Validation:

Identify various data issues:
Missing Data: Detect records missing fields like ManagerID, HireDate, or Department.
Format Issues: Highlight incorrectly formatted fields (e.g., EmployeeID, Email).
Duplicates: Identify duplicate employee records or IDs across systems.
Logical Errors: Find inconsistencies like negative salaries or mismatched department IDs.
Advanced Issue Categorization:

LLMs classify issues into categories (e.g., missing data, formatting errors, logical inconsistencies).
Example: "20% of employee records in HR are missing a department ID."
Root Cause Analysis:

Use LLMs to analyze patterns and suggest reasons for issues.
Example Output:
sql
Copy code
Issue: 35 employees have negative salaries.
Root Cause: Payroll system uploaded incorrect salary adjustments in batch processing on 10/21.
Suggested Fix: Validate all salary adjustments from batch file `batch_1021.csv`.
Automated Self-Repair:

Suggest fixes for common issues:
Add missing prefixes to EmployeeID.
Standardize date formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD).
Flag unresolved issues for review.
Actionable Insights and Analytics:

Provide insights like:
Data Completeness: Percentage of complete vs. incomplete records.
Data Accuracy: Trends in mismatched or incorrect values.
Operational Impact: Metrics like payroll errors caused by data issues.
Use visualizations to track trends (e.g., percentage of missing data over time).
Interactive Querying:

Users can ask:
"How many employees are missing department information?"
"Show duplicate employee IDs between HR and Payroll."
"Which employees have salary discrepancies greater than 10%?"
The system generates results in tables, graphs, or dashboards.
