Current (Point-to-Point)	Proposed (Event-Driven)
High Dependency â€“ If one system fails, others may fail.	Loose Coupling â€“ Systems process independently.
Harder Deployments â€“ Teams need to coordinate & deploy together.	Independent Deployments â€“ No need to sync all services.
Scalability Issues â€“ Adding new systems increases complexity.	Easier Scaling â€“ Just subscribe new services to events.
No Built-in Retry â€“ If a system fails, data may be lost.	Guaranteed Delivery â€“ Data is stored & retried automatically.
More Debugging Needed â€“ Failures are harder to track.	Better Observability â€“ Logs & event tracking simplify monitoring.
ðŸš€ "This shift isnâ€™t just about fixing problems â€“ itâ€™s about future-proofing the business."
