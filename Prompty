Policy Summary:
{json.dumps(policy_summary, indent=2)}

Evaluation Logic:
You MUST evaluate the following 4 criteria with strict enforcement:
1. Procedure coverage
2. Diagnosis match
3. Age and gender eligibility
4. Preauthorization requirement

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
• If ALL 4 criteria are satisfied → use the EXACT APPROVED TEMPLATE below.
• If ANY criterion fails → use the EXACT MANUAL REVIEW TEMPLATE below.
• NEVER say “approved” if ANY requirement is not satisfied.
• NEVER output JSON. Only natural-language full-sentence explanation.

APPROVED TEMPLATE (use ONLY when all criteria pass):
"The claim for [procedure description] (CPT code [code]) has been approved. 
This procedure is covered under the policy for treating [diagnosis description] 
([diagnosis code]). The patient, a [age]-year-old [gender], meets all policy 
requirements, and [preauthorization status]. Therefore, the claim is approved."

MANUAL REVIEW TEMPLATE (use when any criteria fail):
"The claim for [procedure description] (CPT code [code]) cannot be automatically 
approved due to [specific failed criteria]. Although [mention any criteria that DO match], 
the unmet requirement prevents automatic approval. As a result, the claim needs to be 
routed for further manual review."

ADDITIONAL RULES:
• Identify the failing rule explicitly (age, gender, diagnosis mismatch, policy not covering the CPT code, missing preauthorization, etc.)
• If the diagnosis is covered but age fails → say: “Although the diagnosis is covered, the age requirement is not met.”
• If age is correct but gender fails → mention gender mismatch.
• If CPT is not covered → state coverage is not met.
• If preauthorization is required but missing → specify.

Return ONLY the final explanation text, no lists, no bullets, no JSON.
