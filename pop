You are creating a robust Python-based agent application to:

Consume events from Azure Event Hub.

Trigger Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines for each event received (one pipeline run per event).

Implement comprehensive logging for observability and debugging.

Use a dead-letter queue mechanism for events that fail processing.

Include restart and retry logic for resilience.

Track and log each triggered pipeline run's status and completion.

Application Requirements

Event Hub Consumption:

Connect to Azure Event Hub using Azure SDK.

Read each message/event individually.

ADF Pipeline Triggering:

Trigger an ADF pipeline run per event using Azure Data Factory SDK.

Pass event data to the ADF pipeline as parameters.

Logging:

Implement detailed logging using Python’s built-in logging or the loguru library.

Log informational messages, errors, and pipeline statuses.

Dead-letter Queue Handling:

On failures, publish events to a dedicated dead-letter queue (Azure Service Bus Queue).

Clearly log the reason for the failure.

Restart and Retry Logic:

Automatically retry pipeline triggers on transient errors using exponential backoff.

Provide mechanisms for manual restart capability.

Pipeline Tracking:

Track each triggered pipeline’s run status using Azure Data Factory SDK.

Periodically poll and log the pipeline run status (success, failure, or in-progress).

Modular Coding Structure

Your application codebase should be modular and maintainable, structured as follows:

src/
├── main.py
├── eventhub_consumer.py
├── adf_pipeline_trigger.py
├── dead_letter_queue.py
├── tracking.py
├── logging_setup.py
└── utils.py

Module Responsibilities

eventhub_consumer.py:

Set up and handle connections to Azure Event Hub.

Consume events continuously.

adf_pipeline_trigger.py:

Interface with Azure Data Factory.

Trigger pipeline runs, handle errors, and implement retry logic.

dead_letter_queue.py:

Manage the connection to Azure Service Bus.

Publish messages to the dead-letter queue.

tracking.py:

Periodically check and log the status of pipeline runs.

logging_setup.py:

Configure logging settings globally.

utils.py:

Include utility functions such as exponential backoff retries, parameter validation, and environment variable loading.

Key Implementation Details

Use environment variables for configuration (Event Hub connection strings, ADF names, etc.).

Employ robust error handling with try-except blocks.

Ensure idempotency where possible to handle potential duplicates.

Clearly log unique identifiers for tracing events and pipeline runs.

Example Usage

Your main entry point (main.py) should initialize components and start the event loop:

from eventhub_consumer import EventHubConsumer
from logging_setup import setup_logging

def main():
    setup_logging()
    consumer = EventHubConsumer()
    consumer.start_consuming()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Logging Example

Use structured logging clearly indicating:

Timestamp

Event ID

Pipeline run ID

Pipeline status

Error details if any

Dead-letter Queue Message Example

Include the original event payload and error details.

{
  "event_id": "12345",
  "payload": { "key": "value" },
  "error": "Pipeline trigger timeout"
}

Tracking Pipeline Status

Poll ADF pipeline statuses periodically.

Log statuses as:

SUCCESS

IN_PROGRESS

FAILED

Retry Logic

Implement retries with exponential backoff using the tenacity library
