Project Description: Automated Reminder System for Care Agents
Overview
In the healthcare and care management sectors, the timely and accurate creation of reminders for follow-ups, case closures, discharges, and information provisioning is crucial. Care agents often handle multiple cases simultaneously, making it challenging to keep track of all necessary actions without some form of automated assistance. This project develops an automated reminder system that leverages machine learning to classify text inputs and generate appropriate reminders, reducing the manual effort required by care agents and minimizing the risk of human error.

Objective
The primary objective of this system is to automate the process of reminder creation based on the textual data received from various interactions and communications with members. By categorizing text inputs into predefined classes, such as "close_case", "follow_up", "discharge", and "provide_information", the system can suggest specific reminders that need to be set. This automation aims to:

Reduce manual efforts of care agents in creating reminders.
Decrease the likelihood of human errors, such as forgetting to set a reminder or setting incorrect ones.
Enhance the efficiency of care operations by ensuring timely follow-ups and case management.
Solution Description
The solution involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather and preprocess historical data of interactions that include agent notes, communication logs, and previous reminders.
Model Training: Use machine learning techniques to train models capable of understanding and classifying text data. The training process involves:
Text vectorization using TF-IDF to convert text data into a format suitable for model training.
Hyperparameter tuning for multiple machine learning models to find the most effective configurations.
Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Selection and Implementation: Select the best-performing model based on predefined metrics and integrate it into the existing care management system to automate the process of creating reminders.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows care agents to input text and receive automated recommendations for reminders.
Technologies Used
Python: For scripting and model development.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development.
Joblib: For model serialization and deserialization.
Matplotlib: For generating visualizations of model performance.
Benefits
Increased Productivity: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing care agents to focus on more critical aspects of patient care.
Reduced Errors: Minimizes the chances of forgetting to set reminders or setting them incorrectly.
Consistency and Reliability: Ensures that all necessary follow-up actions are consistently reminded across all cases, improving the overall quality of care.
Future Enhancements
Integration with Real-time Data Streams: To allow for real-time reminder setting as new data arrives.
Expansion to Multi-language Support: To cater to non-English speaking clients and expand the usability of the system.
Advanced Predictive Analytics: To predict the need for future reminders based on ongoing case analysis.
