**Data Cleaning Micro-Product: DataCleanPro**

### **Micro-Product Concept**: **DataCleanPro**

A lightweight, standalone **data cleaning tool** that integrates easily into existing workflows. It will help users clean, validate, and update data in **real-time**, reducing the batch processing load.

---

### **Core Features**

1. **Data Viewer**:
   - A minimal UI to fetch and display raw data in a tabular format.
   - Pagination, search, and filtering to navigate large datasets efficiently.

2. **Inline Editing**:
   - Direct editing of data fields (e.g., text, numbers, dates).
   - Real-time validation for incorrect or missing data.

3. **Bulk Actions**:
   - Select multiple rows to apply bulk updates (e.g., status changes, value updates).

4. **Validation Engine**:
   - Pre-built validation rules (e.g., date formats, unique constraints).
   - Custom rule support for specific data types or formats.

5. **Change Tracking**:
   - Track all changes made to the dataset.
   - Provide a "revert" button to undo specific changes.

6. **Data Submission**:
   - Submit cleaned data to the backend.
   - Optional export as a CSV/Excel file for further offline processing.

7. **Integration Hooks**:
   - API endpoints for seamless integration with existing systems (batch process, ETL pipelines).
   - Webhooks to notify other systems about data updates.
