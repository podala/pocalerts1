The team has successfully delivered several critical improvements in the CMT application, including a solution for API call vulnerabilities on the Camunda side, which has strengthened system security and efficiency. On the P&L side, we made a concerted effort to streamline processes, achieving a significant job reduction of around 50%. These accomplishments have not only optimized performance but have also enhanced the overall stability and security of our systems.

Moving forward, we are focused on operationalizing these gains to support business objectives effectively, and we aim to continue driving impactful changes across our platforms.
