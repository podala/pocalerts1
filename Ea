Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to address performance issues we've observed in production, specifically with the Contact and Time Zone APIs. Both APIs have exceeded the defined Service Level Agreement (SLA) response times, causing concerns about their reliability.

I would like to bring to your attention that Jeff and Kerry are planning to escalate the issue with the Contact API to the EPMP team for further investigation and resolution. Their insights and expertise will be crucial in understanding the root cause and ensuring that such issues do not recur.

Additionally, we have noticed that the Time Zone API's Transactions Per Second (TPS) rate might be contributing to the performance challenges. Could we discuss the possibility of increasing the TPS for the Time Zone API? We believe that this adjustment might alleviate some of the current bottlenecks.

Ensuring optimal performance for our APIs is crucial to maintaining the trust and satisfaction of our users. We appreciate your prompt attention to these matters and look forward to your feedback and suggestions.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
