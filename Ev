usage and optimize processes, potentially lowering operational costs.
Scalability & Flexibility: Allows for better scalability and adaptability to changing business needs.
Competitive Advantage: Faster processing can lead to quicker business decisions and responses to market changes.
Why does Gulsun care? (Product Owner Perspective)

Delivery of Business Value: Ensuring that the architecture supports the business goals with minimal disruptions.
Accountability: Gulsun may need to justify the investment in this new approach with clear ROI metrics.
Why does Rich care? (Product Owner Perspective)

Operational Stability: Ensuring that the event-driven approach doesn’t introduce new operational risks or complexities.
Team Readiness: Concerned about the team's ability to adapt to the new architecture and maintain performance.
What does technology gain and why do they care?

Simplified Architecture: Reduction in complex integrations and dependencies between services.
Real-time Data Processing: Enables real-time analytics and quicker feedback loops.
Reduced Downtime: More resilient systems with features like event replay and dead-letter queues.
If we don’t do anything, what is the risk?

Obsolescence: Risk of falling behind competitors leveraging more modern, efficient architectures.
Scalability Issues: Current systems may not scale efficiently with growing data loads.
Increased Maintenance Costs: Legacy systems may incur higher maintenance costs over time.
2. What Is the Ask?
How does this work?

Implementing an event-driven architecture using Kafka/Event Hub to decouple services, allowing asynchronous processing and better fault tolerance.
What is a sequence diagram for how this solves issues?

Events are published to a central hub (Kafka/Event Hub), which other services subscribe to. This reduces direct dependencies and allows services to operate independently.
Focus Areas:

Deployments: Streamlined through containerization and continuous integration pipelines.
Resilience: Built-in mechanisms like retries, dead-letter queues, and fault-tolerant event processing.
Other Benefits: Scalability, real-time insights, and improved system performance.
3. What Does This Look Like if Implemented?
Cost Comparison:
Compare the current costs (infrastructure, maintenance) with event-driven architecture costs (Kafka/Event Hub licensing, cloud resources, training).
4. Estimated Costs in Hours (for Each Team):
Task	Estimated Hours	Responsible Team/Individual
Designing Event Architecture	40 hours	Architecture Team
Development & Implementation	80 hours	Engineering Team
Integration with Case Management	30 hours	Case Management Team
Integration with RRF	30 hours	RRF Team
Testing & QA	40 hours	QA Team
Monitoring & Setting up Dead Letter Queue	20 hours	DevOps/Abhilash
Documentation (SOPs, diagrams)	20 hours	Technical Writers
Team Training	10 hours	Abhilash (Training Sessions)
Total	270 hours	
5. Risks and Mitigations:
Risk: Lack of operational materials or documentation.

Mitigation: Ensure SOPs and diagrams are created alongside development.
Risk: Team unfamiliarity with monitoring tools.

Mitigation: Training from Abhilash on monitoring and issue resolution.
Risk: Incidents due to incomplete testing.

Mitigation: Comprehensive testing with zero tolerance for missed scenarios.
