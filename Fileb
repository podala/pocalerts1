I hope this email finds you well. As we progress in our project, I've noticed some ambiguity regarding the location and method for storing the response ID. To ensure the smooth continuation of our work and to meet our project milestones timely, I'd like to seek some clarifications.

Response ID Storage: Could you specify where we are expected to store the response ID? Are there any particular formats or systems we should adhere to while saving this data?

Detailed Requirements: In order to ensure that our work aligns perfectly with the project's objectives, it would be greatly beneficial if we could receive a detailed requirement list. This will help us in cross-checking and ensuring that we haven't missed out on any crucial aspects.

Workflow Documentation: A complete and clear workflow will greatly aid us in understanding the steps involved and in planning our tasks more efficiently. If there's already existing documentation on this, kindly share it. If not, we'd appreciate if we could collaborate to develop one.

Your timely response will not only help in resolving the current confusion but also pave the way for a streamlined and efficient workflow in the days to come.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Looking forward to your guidance on the above-mentioned points
