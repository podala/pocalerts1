Following our recent discussion, we have completed the analysis of the tech-related challenges and have planned a phase-wise implementation to address them. This strategic approach will allow us to achieve a more streamlined and efficient system, with a significant reduction in API calls.

Key Highlights:

The proposed plan will focus on resolving all tech-related issues in clearly defined phases.
Based on the analysis, we anticipate achieving a reduction of more than 40% in API calls by optimizing the current infrastructure and processes.
Each phase will be structured to prioritize high-impact areas first, ensuring that the API reduction targets are met as we proceed.
Our team will work on a detailed project timeline and task breakdown for each phase, which will be shared with you shortly.

Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to schedule a meeting to discuss further.
