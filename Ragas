Here is a **clear evaluation of how RAGAS was used in this case study** .

# 📊 What They Did with RAGAS in This Study

## 1️⃣ Purpose of Using RAGAS

They used **RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment)** to:

* Measure how well the RAG pipeline performs
* Evaluate both **retrieval quality** and **generated answer quality**
* Compare old vs new embeddings
* Compare GPT models

So RAGAS was the **evaluation engine** for the entire experiment.

# 📈 Metrics They Evaluated Using RAGAS

| Metric                | What It Measures                                | Why It Matters             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Faithfulness**      | Whether answer is grounded in retrieved context | Detects hallucination      |
| **Answer Relevancy**  | Whether answer addresses the question properly  | Measures usefulness        |
| **Context Precision** | How much retrieved context is truly relevant    | Measures retrieval quality |
| **Context Recall**    | Whether all important context was retrieved     | Measures completeness      |

These four metrics were the **core evaluation parameters**.

# 🏗 How RAGAS Was Applied in Their Pipeline

Their evaluation workflow (from methodology section):

1. Retrieve top-k chunks using MongoDB Vector Search
2. Generate answer using GPT model
3. Pass:

   * Question
   * Retrieved Context
   * Generated Answer
     into RAGAS
4. Compute evaluation metrics
5. Aggregate results across 232 dataset samples

# 🔬 RAGAS Results They Found

## 🔹 Embedding Comparison Results

| Metric            | text-embedding-3-small | text-embedding-ada-002 | Improvement |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Context Precision | 0.6940                 | 0.5317                 | +30.6%      |
| Context Recall    | 0.7529                 | 0.5688                 | +32.4%      |

👉 RAGAS proved new embedding retrieves better context.

## 🔹 Completion Model Results

| Model         | Faithfulness | Relevancy |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| GPT-4o-mini   | **0.9067**   | 0.8450    |
| GPT-3.5-turbo | 0.8901       | 0.5317    |
| GPT-3.5-1106  | 0.8445       | **0.887** |

👉 RAGAS showed:

* GPT-4o-mini best for hallucination control
* GPT-3.5-1106 best for relevancy

---

# 📊 Important Insight They Found Using RAGAS

They discovered:

### 🔻 Trade-off Relationship

Faithfulness and relevancy have **negative correlation (r = -0.356)**

Meaning:

* Higher factual grounding may slightly reduce answer elaboration
* More elaborative answers may reduce strict grounding

This is a major research insight derived from RAGAS metrics.

# 🧠 What Exactly RAGAS Helped Them Prove

| Question                               | Answer via RAGAS                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Is new embedding better?               | Yes — precision & recall improved  |
| Does MongoDB vector search work well?  | Yes — retrieval quality improved   |
| Which GPT model is safest?             | GPT-4o-mini (highest faithfulness) |
| Which GPT model is most context-aware? | GPT-3.5-1106                       |

# 🎯 Final Evaluation of Their RAGAS Usage

### ✅ Strengths

* Used standard benchmark dataset
* Measured both retrieval + generation
* Did statistical analysis
* Compared across models
* Provided numerical improvements

### ⚠ Limitations

* Small dataset (232 samples)
* Only English dataset
* No domain-specific test
* No adversarial evaluation
* No latency / cost metric in RAGAS

# 🔎 Simple Summary

They used RAGAS as:

> A scientific scoring system to validate their MongoDB + embedding + GPT RAG pipeline.

And RAGAS proved that:

* New embedding improves retrieval
* GPT-4o-mini reduces hallucination
* MongoDB Atlas vector search is effective
* There is a trade-off between faithfulness and relevancy
