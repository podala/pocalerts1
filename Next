Yes 👍 — **Next.js *can* be packaged**, but **how you do it matters**.
Let me explain **clearly and practically**, and also tell you **when you should NOT do it**.

---

## Short Answer

👉 **You should NOT package a full Next.js app as a reusable library**
👉 **You SHOULD package reusable parts (UI, hooks, utils) separately**

---

## Why Full Next.js App ≠ Package

Next.js is **an application framework**, not a component library.

A Next.js app contains:

* Routing (`app/`, `pages/`)
* API routes (`app/api`)
* Server Components
* Middleware
* Build + runtime config
* Deployment logic

📦 **Packages are meant to be reusable logic**, not full apps.

So this is ❌ **NOT recommended**:

```text
@company/nextjs-app
```

---

## What You *CAN* Package from Next.js (Best Practice)

### ✅ 1. UI Component Package (MOST COMMON)

Create reusable components used across apps.

📦 `@company/ui`

```text
packages/
 └── ui/
     ├── Button.tsx
     ├── DataGrid.tsx
     ├── Card.tsx
     ├── index.ts
```

Used inside Next.js:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@company/ui";
```

✔ Works perfectly with Next.js
✔ Tree-shakable
✔ Reusable across teams

---

### ✅ 2. Hooks Package

Reusable hooks like auth, feature flags, data fetching.

📦 `@company/hooks`

```ts
export function useUser() {}
export function usePermissions() {}
```

---

### ✅ 3. Utils / Business Logic Package

Pricing logic, validation, formatters.

📦 `@company/utils`

```ts
export function calculateRebate() {}
export function formatCurrency() {}
```

---

### ✅ 4. API / SDK Package

Client to talk to backend services.

📦 `@company/api-client`

```ts
export class PricingAPI {
  getRates() {}
}
```

---

## Recommended Enterprise Setup (Monorepo)

Since you earlier asked about **monorepo advantages**, this is the **ideal setup**:

```text
apps/
 ├── web-nextjs/        ← Next.js app
 ├── admin-nextjs/
packages/
 ├── ui/
 ├── hooks/
 ├── utils/
 ├── api-client/
```

Tools:

* **Turborepo** (best for Next.js)
* or **Nx**
* or **pnpm workspaces**

✔ Shared versioning
✔ One build pipeline
✔ Zero duplication

---

## Can You Publish a Next.js Package to NPM?

Technically ❌ **Not useful**

Why?

* Needs `next build`
* Needs routing context
* Needs deployment target
* Needs env vars

So it **breaks the package model**.

---

## Special Case: Internal Platform Teams

You *can* create:

```text
@company/nextjs-template
```

Used as:

```bash
npx create-company-app
```

But that is a **template**, not a package.

---

## Simple Rule (Remember This)

| Goal                | Use      |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Reuse UI            | Package  |
| Reuse logic         | Package  |
| Reuse hooks         | Package  |
| Reuse full Next app | ❌ No     |
| Share standards     | Template |
| Enterprise scaling  | Monorepo |

---

## Recommendation for You (Based on Your Work)

Given your **PBM dashboards, underwriting apps, multiple teams**:

✅ **Monorepo + Next.js apps + shared packages**
❌ Avoid packaging Next.js apps themselves

If you want, next I can:

* Show **step-by-step** how to create `@company/ui` with Next.js
* Show **Turborepo setup**
* Compare **Next.js monorepo vs React monorepo**
