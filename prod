You are building a production-grade data pipeline to process Excel-based drug pricing models using PySpark. Your goals are: performance, reliability, modularity, and maintainability.

Design and implement the following:

1. âœ… Core Spark Pipeline Requirements
Read a large .xlsx file using com.crealytics.spark.excel

Use a singleton-based SparkSessionManager to avoid reinitialization

Each row represents a drug entity with Key, DrugName, modelId, and other columns

Columns like PostShift_Scripts_2025, Base_QTY_2026 represent metrics per year and per section

2. âœ… Parallel Section Calculators
Define the following section calculators:

PostShiftCalculator

BaseCalculator

MAFCalculator

PPLCalculator

WACCalculator

PPACalculator

Each implements:

python
Copy
Edit
def apply(self, df: DataFrame, config: dict) -> DataFrame
Run them in parallel using ThreadPoolExecutor (or any safe concurrency option with cached DataFrame)

Each returns a DataFrame with Key and prefixed columns (e.g., PostShift_Scripts_2025)

3. âœ… Merge and Serialization
Merge all section outputs on Key (using outer join)

Define a DrugVariantRecord using @dataclass to standardize JSON output

Convert Spark rows to Python dicts using rdd.map + DrugVariantRecord.to_dict()

4. âœ… Cosmos DB Writer
Use a CosmosDBWriter singleton:

Accepts cosmos_config (account, key, database, container)

Handles retry logic using tenacity

Method: write(json_rdd)

Configurable TTL and partitionKey support

5. âœ… Validation with Great Expectations
Before writing to Cosmos DB, validate the merged DataFrame:

Check required columns exist (e.g., Key, modelId, DrugName)

Ensure no nulls in critical fields

Ensure metrics per section fall within reasonable numeric range

Expectation suite should be defined inline or loaded from YAML

Abort write if validation fails

6. âœ… Pipeline Orchestration
Load config from pipeline_config.yaml:

years, ttl, metrics_per_section, cosmos_config, input_path

Initialize and cache the Excel DataFrame

Run section calculators in parallel

Merge all section results

Validate merged DataFrame via Great Expectations

Serialize and write to Cosmos DB

Log each stageâ€™s duration and outcome

7. âœ… Logging, Retries, and Observability
Use Pythonâ€™s logging module throughout

Retry all critical phases (extract, write) using tenacity

Count rows at each stage

Log partition count, Spark job duration

ðŸŽ¯ Final Deliverables
You should produce:

base_pipeline.py â†’ reusable abstract pipeline class

drug_variant_pipeline.py â†’ orchestrator

section_calculators/*.py â†’ modular logic per section

models/drug_variant_record.py â†’ dataclass with .to_dict()

writer/cosmos_writer.py â†’ singleton Cosmos DB writer with retry

utils/spark_manager.py â†’ singleton SparkSession

validations/expectation_suite.json or inline GE rules

main.py â†’ glue script with config loader (YAML or dict)

pipeline_config.yaml â†’ contains all inputs, Cosmos settings, section metadata
