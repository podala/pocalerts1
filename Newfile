Subject: Optimizing Cache & Database Workloads in Our Microservices Environment

Dear [Recipient Name/Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss and propose some changes regarding our current infrastructure and application design:

Global/Distributed Cache:

To enhance performance, I recommend updating both the cache and database asynchronously. This strategy could lessen the immediate burden on the database while ensuring our cached data stays current. Leveraging tools such as Redis or Memcached might be beneficial in this context.
Microproduct Development:

For best results, each microproduct should undergo comprehensive testing in a local environment.
If there's an indication of any performance or design bottlenecks, we might need to consider a redesign of the affected microproduct. The primary objective is to ease the strain on the database.
Review of MBR COV DTL Time Fields:

An audit seems necessary to determine which downstream applications are utilizing certain fields.
For data efficiency, if we identify fields that aren't actively in use, it might be a good idea to remove them. This can simplify our data model and prevent unnecessary data retrievals.
GraphQL & Risk Score:

To exclusively showcase the risk score, creating an additional GraphQL endpoint seems like a viable solution.
I've also observed that while QRHub can persist data in an alternative table, doing so in microproducts like Practice Manager might hamper performance, especially when we're pulling information for 400 to 500 members.

I welcome any feedback or suggestions on the above points. Let's work together to streamline our processes and ensure optimal performance.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

I understand that you'd like to refine the section on "GraphQL & Risk Score". Here's a revision based on your input:

GraphQL & Risk Score:

To exclusively showcase the risk score, considering an additional GraphQL endpoint appears to be a sound approach. However, there's a performance concern to address: introducing an extra GraphQL field may pose challenges to the Practice Manager's efficiency. We need to weigh the benefits of this addition against potential performance implications.

Feel free to make any more adjustments or provide additional context, and I'll help you refine further.
