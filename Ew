As part of my role, I have contributed significantly to AI/ML initiatives in the care management domain, successfully completing 10 proof-of-concepts (POCs) that focus on enhancing decision-making and automation. These POCs have laid the groundwork for scalable solutions that align with our strategic objectives.

To meet Optum Rx PBM commitments, I am focused on supporting the operationalization of the Client Pricing Management (MGT) system to quantify its value, while actively participating in the ideation and implementation of AI/ML business-specific use cases. My approach is to ensure that each project aligns with measurable business outcomes, from RxClaim modernization efforts to optimizing enterprise risk. Additionally, I aim to leverage AI/ML to streamline efficiencies in prior authorization processes, impacting metrics such as case resolution rates and client satisfaction.

My goal for the coming period is to convert these POCs into scalable production solutions, while closely collaborating with leadership and stakeholders to meet PBM targets and contribute to enterprise-level objectives effectively.
