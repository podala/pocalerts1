The primary objective of this project is the research and development of a GUI-Based Customer Network Issue Resolution Portal for AT&T. This web-based platform will enable AT&T engineers and customers to identify, diagnose, and resolve network issues in real-time. The portal aims to streamline the resolution process by offering a user-friendly interface, automated diagnostics, and detailed insights into network performance.

The project will focus on improving network reliability, minimizing downtime, and enhancing the customer experience by providing proactive solutions to common network issues. The portal will integrate with AT&T’s existing network infrastructure and tools to offer seamless operations.

The key expectations from this project include:

Investigating the feasibility and benefits of automated network issue diagnosis and resolution.
Enhancing the reliability and scalability of network monitoring and troubleshooting processes.
Reducing costs associated with manual interventions and support calls.
Improving customer satisfaction through faster response times and transparency.
Additionally, the project will address challenges such as integration with existing systems, data privacy, and ensuring security compliance.
