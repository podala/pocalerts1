Architecture Overview:
Azure SQL: The relational database where all the data resides.
GraphQL API Layer: Serves the data from Azure SQL and dynamically responds based on the requested fields.
Authentication/Authorization: Integrates with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
Data Caching Layer: A Redis or Azure Cache for Redis layer to cache frequently queried data to reduce the load on Azure SQL.
Pagination & Filtering: Implementation to handle large datasets efficiently.
Logging and Monitoring: Using Azure Monitor and Application Insights for full observability.
Scalability: The API is deployed in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Azure App Service for scaling based on demand.


1. Define GraphQL Schema with 200+ Fields
Design a comprehensive GraphQL schema that includes all possible fields from the Azure SQL database, but expose only the necessary ones dynamically based on the query.

type Customer {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    email: String
    phoneNumber: String
    address: Address
    # 200 other fields
}

type Address {
    street: String
    city: String
    zipCode: String
}

type Query {
    customers(filter: CustomerFilter, pagination: PaginationInput): [Customer]
}

input CustomerFilter {
    id: ID
    name: String
    email: String
    # Filters for other fields if needed
}

input PaginationInput {
    limit: Int
    offset: Int
}

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        customers: async (_, { filter, pagination }, context) => {
            // Example of dynamically constructing SQL query
            const selectedFields = context.requestedFields; // Extract fields from GraphQL query
            const fields = selectedFields.join(', ');

            const sqlQuery = `
              SELECT ${fields} 
              FROM Customers 
              WHERE ${generateFilterConditions(filter)}
              OFFSET ${pagination.offset} ROWS
              FETCH NEXT ${pagination.limit} ROWS ONLY;
            `;
            
            return await azureSqlQuery(sqlQuery);
        }
    }
};
Field Selection Logic: The context.requestedFields extracts the exact fields requested in the GraphQL query, dynamically adjusting the SQL query.
Filtering & Pagination: You can add filtering logic based on user input and paginate results to handle large datasets.

3. Integrate Authentication & Authorization
For an enterprise-level GraphQL service, integrate Azure AD for authentication and ensure that only authorized users can access specific fields or datasets.
type Query {
    customers(filter: CustomerFilter, pagination: PaginationInput): [Customer] @auth(requires: ["Admin", "Manager"])
}
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Use Azure AD to assign roles and permissions. In the resolver, verify the userâ€™s role and restrict access to sensitive fields or data.
4. Caching Frequently Accessed Data
To reduce the load on Azure SQL and improve response times, cache frequently queried data using Azure Cache for Redis.
const cachedData = await redisClient.get(cacheKey);
if (cachedData) {
    return JSON.parse(cachedData);
} else {
    const data = await azureSqlQuery(sqlQuery);
    redisClient.set(cacheKey, JSON.stringify(data), 'EX', 3600); // Cache data for 1 hour
    return data;
}Caching Strategy: Cache the results of common queries, and refresh the cache when data is updated or after a specific TTL (Time to Live).


Final Architecture Overview:
Data Source: Azure SQL stores all data.
GraphQL API: A dynamically structured GraphQL API serves as the endpoint to fetch selected fields from Azure SQL.
Auth/Role-based Access Control: Secure access using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for enterprise-grade security.
Caching Layer: Redis caching for frequently accessed data.
Monitoring: Azure Monitor and Application Insights to observe performance and errors.
Deployment: The API is containerized and deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for scalability.
