Example Scenario: Healthcare Task Management System
Context:
Let's consider a healthcare task management system that handles various tasks such as referral handling, member follow-ups, and program management. We will calculate the database capacity and the number of requests per second (RPS) that the system can handle.

Step 1: Understanding the Requirements
Types of Data:

Member data
Task data
Program data
User data
Average Sizes:

Member record: 1 KB
Task record: 2 KB
Program record: 1.5 KB
User record: 0.5 KB
System Operations:

Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for each type of data.
Expected Load:

Average number of members: 100,000
Average number of tasks per day: 50,000
Average number of programs per day: 10,000
Average number of users: 1,000
Step 2: Estimating Data Size
Daily Data Growth:

Member data: 100,000 members * 1 KB = 100,000 KB (100 MB)
Task data: 50,000 tasks * 2 KB = 100,000 KB (100 MB)
Program data: 10,000 programs * 1.5 KB = 15,000 KB (15 MB)
User data: 1,000 users * 0.5 KB = 500 KB (0.5 MB)
Total Daily Data Growth:

Total daily data: 100 MB + 100 MB + 15 MB + 0.5 MB = 215.5 MB
Monthly Data Growth:

Total monthly data: 215.5 MB/day * 30 days = 6,465 MB (approximately 6.5 GB)
Annual Data Growth:

Total annual data: 6.5 GB/month * 12 months = 78 GB
Step 3: Database Capacity Planning
Data Retention Policy:

Let's assume we need to retain data for 5 years.
Total data for 5 years: 78 GB/year * 5 years = 390 GB
Additional Storage for Indexes and Overhead:

Typically, add 20-30% overhead.
Storage requirement with overhead: 390 GB * 1.3 = 507 GB
Choosing Database Storage:

Based on the calculated requirement, we need at least 507 GB of storage for our database.
Step 4: Calculating Requests per Second (RPS)
Peak Load Estimation:

Assume the system operates 16 hours a day.
Tasks handled per second: 50,000 tasks / (16 hours * 3600 seconds) ≈ 0.87 tasks/sec
Programs handled per second: 10,000 programs / (16 hours * 3600 seconds) ≈ 0.17 programs/sec
Total peak RPS (tasks + programs): 0.87 + 0.17 ≈ 1.04 RPS
Including Member and User Operations:

Let's assume members and users have an equal number of CRUD operations as tasks.
Total peak RPS including members and users: 1.04 (tasks + programs) + 0.87 (members) + 0.17 (users) ≈ 2.08 RPS
Step 5: Performance Tuning and Scalability
Database Tuning:

Indexing frequently accessed columns.
Using partitioning for large tables.
Optimizing query performance.
Scalability:

Vertical scaling: Increasing hardware resources (CPU, RAM).
Horizontal scaling: Distributing load across multiple database instances using sharding or replication.
Load Balancing:

Implementing load balancers to distribute requests evenly across database servers.
Caching:

Utilizing caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce database load for frequently accessed data.
