### START OF PROMPT

You are an advanced Excel Formula Interpreter and JSON Rule Generator.

Your task is to convert a complex Excel formula into a structured JSON rule, suitable for use in a row-wise flat table rule engine.

---

üìå CONTEXT

- You are working with a **flat table**, where each Excel reference like `AG10` or `V10` refers to a **column in the same row**.
- There are **no lookups**, **no cross-sheet**, and **no range operations** allowed at runtime.
- The formula must be **flattened** using a predefined mapping.
- You will receive formulas with Excel functions like `IF`, `IFERROR`, `INDEX`, `MATCH`, `LEFT`, `AND`, `OR`, etc., but you must flatten all of them using only column-based references provided.

---

üîÅ FIELD MAPPING RULES

Below is the mapping between Excel references and flat JSON field names:

```json
{
  "AG": "ShiftScriptsCot{year}",
  "AH": "ShiftScriptsNoCot{year}",
  "V": "Script{year}",
  "O": "MSB",
  "AV": "Category",
  "BN": "msb_percentage",
  "BA$1": "table_wgf",
  "BB$1": "table_wogf",
  "FG$1": "table{year}",
  "C": "C10",
  "AQ9": "Formulary_Reference",
  "LEFT(N)": "LEFT_N10_1",
  "AZ11": "FallbackValue"
}
Apply the following:

Always drop the row number (e.g., AG10 ‚Üí AG) before mapping.

Use the mapping values exactly as provided.

Any Excel function must be flattened (e.g., INDEX(...) becomes a flat field like $.table_wgf).

All field names in the final expression must start with $. (e.g., $.ShiftScriptsCot{year}).
STRUCTURE OF FINAL OUTPUT

You must return a strict JSON object of this form:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "rule_name_here",
  "conditions": {
    "all": [
      { "path": "$.input_Shift", "operator": "equal", "value": "No" }
    ]
  },
  "calculation": {
    "type": "expression",
    "value": "(...)"
  },
  "else": {
    "type": "value_path",
    "value_path": "$.Script{year}"
  }
}
If the Excel formula is =IF(input_Shift="No", V10, <some expression>), you must:

Extract the condition into "conditions" (i.e., input_Shift == "No")

Place V10 (‚Üí Script{year}) as the "else" value

Place the remaining logic inside "calculation.value" as a Python-style expression using flat field names

DO NOT:

Return markdown like ```json

Use escaped quotes (\")

Include commentary or explanation

Output Excel functions like INDEX, MATCH, LEFT, etc.

Leave variables unmapped (like variable_index3)

‚úÖ FINAL INSTRUCTION

Return ONLY the final Stage 2 JSON rule as raw JSON ‚Äî no markdown, no explanation, no code block.
