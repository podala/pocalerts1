Wait from Azure data lake and delta tables

Below is a rule-of-thumb performance comparison for analytical reads when your files live in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account at different access tiers versus the same data materialised as Delta Lake tables (e.g., queried from a Databricks cluster or Synapse Spark).
Times assume a healthy Spark cluster already running, wide-column Parquet files (~1 GB each), and no extra indexing on the raw files (for Delta, we assume OPTIMIZE + Z-ORDER has been run once). All figures come from Microsoft’s documented latency guidance and community benchmarks; treat them as averages, not SLAs.

Scenario (≈ data size)	Hot tier	Cool tier	Archive tier†	Delta Lake (same tier)
150 M rows (~50 GB)	≈ 45–90 s full scan; ≤ 15 s with column pruning	≈ 55–110 s (≈ 20 % slower I/O)	Unavailable in real time – must rehydrate first (≤ 10 GB → <1 h high-priority, ≤ 15 h standard)

≈ 8–20 s (data skipping + metadata caching)

1 TB	≈ 12–18 min sequential read (SSD-backed hardware; 60–80 MB/s per executor)	≈ 15–22 min	Rehydrate 1–2 TB/day → 12–24 h just to open the files 
Microsoft Learn
≈ 2–5 min once files online (partition pruning + Z-ORDER)
10 TB (long-range history)	≈ 2–3 h if you really scan it all	≈ 2.5–4 h	Rehydrate 10 TB = ~5–10 days (standard) before query	≈ 15–30 min for targeted queries (statistics eliminate 90 %+ of files)

† Archive tier: Objects are offline; every read triggers a rehydration job. Standard priority can take up to 15 h per blob < 10 GB; high priority is faster (≈ <1 h) but costs more. The service limits rehydration throughput to ≈ 10 GiB per hour per storage account.

Why the big differences?
Hot vs Cool – identical durability, but Cool keeps data on lower-RPM disks; sequential throughput is similar, yet first-byte latency and small random reads are ~15-25 % slower.

Archive – data is kept on offline tape-like media. You pay pennies per GB stored, but hours (or days for TB-scale) in rehydration time plus high read fees. Archive is therefore write-once-read-rarely only.

Delta Lake layer – keeps a compact transaction log and file-level statistics. Spark can skip irrelevant files and converge on just the partitions that matter. Benchmarks show 5–10× reduction in I/O and even larger gains as tables reach PB scale.

Practical guidance for your 150 M-row (≈ 50 GB/day) workloads
Need	Recommended setup
Interactive exploration, BI dashboards	Hot tier + Delta (fastest first-byte and metadata pruning)
Daily batch aggregations, retention ≥ 30 days but infrequent replay	Cool tier + Delta (30–40 % cheaper storage; only ~20 % slower)
Regulatory archive, rarely accessed, SLA ≥ 24 h	Archive tier (raw Parquet) + secondary Hot copy of Delta summaries. Keep a tiny, up-to-date Delta “gold” layer in Hot/Cool for analytics; park raw history in Archive with lifecycle rules.

Bottom line
Hot gives you sub-minute scans; Cool is mildly slower but cheaper; Archive is not query-able on-demand. Wrapping data in Delta Lake on Hot/Cool dramatically shortens query time by avoiding full-file scans and should be considered standard for 100 M+ row analytics workloads on ADLS.
