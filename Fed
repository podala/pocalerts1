Proposed Tech Stack Details
Technology Stack Overview:
Frontend: React.js (for building a dynamic and responsive UI)
Backend: Azure Functions with Webhooks (for real-time event handling)
Storage: Azure Blob Storage (for file upload and storage management)
Approval Workflow: Integration with DoA (Delegation of Authority) application (via Webhooks or REST API for approval workflows)
Performance: Ensuring zero latency between file upload and DoA approval process, with dynamic configurations for different clients
User Experience: Focused on seamless integration with real-time feedback and updates after document uploads and approvals
Dynamic Configurations: Enabling dynamic configurations for different clients based on their custom needs (selecting headers, variables, and processing logic)
