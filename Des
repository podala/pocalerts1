Please describe the nature of the work I did with/for you:

Miriam played a crucial role in my onboarding process by providing guidance on understanding the Pulse system. She acted as a bridge between the architecture and product teams, creating solution diagrams and working closely with the development and DevOps teams. Her support extended to writing code to aid DevOps functions and actively participating in architecture and product calls to support the Pulse ecosystem. Additionally, she provided various contacts and resources for system discussions.
Based on your observations, what did I do well?

Miriam demonstrated excellent knowledge and expertise in full-stack development and AI/ML skills. She proactively worked to stay updated on the latest technology stack and shared valuable insights with the team. Her ability to facilitate communication between teams and provide technical support in both development and architecture discussions added significant value. Miriamâ€™s commitment to continuous learning and her proactive approach in training on new technologies were also impressive.
What could I have done better?

While Miriam excelled in many areas, there is an opportunity for her to influence and expedite some key business decisions. Due to dependencies on other leaders, certain decisions are delayed. If she could work on streamlining the decision-making process and ensuring alignment with key stakeholders, it could help reduce delays and improve the efficiency of project timelines.
