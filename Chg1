Enterprise-Level Data Model for Change Tracking & Reconciliation
To build a scalable and future-proof enterprise data model, we need a design that ensures:

Efficient change tracking with versioning.
Auditability of all underwriter changes.
Seamless reconciliation between changes and file uploads.
Support for future expansions (e.g., new data sources, workflows, real-time processing).
1Ô∏è‚É£ Enterprise-Level Data Model
We will design three core tables:

Change Log Table (change_log) ‚Üí Tracks underwriter changes with versioning.
File Upload Tracking Table (file_uploads) ‚Üí Tracks when the original file is uploaded.
Reconciliation Status Table (reconciliation_status) ‚Üí Helps track delayed uploads and provides a centralized view for business users.
