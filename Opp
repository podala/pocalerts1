Document quality checks can be implemented using a combination of AI techniques, automation tools, and rule-based validations. Here's a detailed explanation of how document quality checks can be performed:

1. Text Extraction and Analysis
To validate the content of a document, the first step is to extract the text from it. This is particularly useful for PDFs, Word documents, or scanned files.

Steps:
OCR (Optical Character Recognition): For scanned documents or images, OCR tools like Tesseract, Google Vision, or Azure Computer Vision can be used to extract text.
Text Parsing: For structured documents (e.g., Word or PDF), libraries like PyPDF2, Apache Tika, or docx extract text directly.
Example Use Cases:
Check whether the document contains critical keywords like Pricing Terms, Client Name, or Opportunity ID.
Detect missing sections (e.g., no summary, missing signature, or missing appendices).
2. AI-Powered Content Validation
Once the text is extracted, AI models can validate the
