Business Requirements for Timezone Assignment to Member Addresses
Objective
To add a timezone field to each address type (Confidential, Temporary, Primary) associated with a member. The timezone will be determined based on the state of the given address.

Requirements
Data Fields

A new field named "Timezone" must be added to each address type: Confidential, Temporary, and Primary.
Initial Data Collection

During the member registration or address update process, the timezone must be auto-filled or selected based on the state of the address.
State-to-Timezone Mapping

Implement a pre-defined mapping between each U.S. state and its corresponding time zone(s).
For non-U.S. states, implement a separate mapping list.
Data Validation

Ensure that only valid state names trigger a timezone selection.
If the state name is invalid, prompt the user to correct it.
User Interface

The "Timezone" field should be non-editable by the user and should auto-populate once the state is selected or entered.
Edit Functionality

When a user edits the state in an address, the timezone should automatically update to correspond with the new state.
Database Update

Ensure that the database schema supports this new "Timezone" field for all address types.
API Integration

Update existing APIs to include the new "Timezone" field in the GET and POST methods for member information.
Fallback

If a timezone cannot be determined based on the state, a default timezone should be used.
Audit and Logs

All changes to the "Timezone" field should be logged for auditing purposes.
Testing

Conduct unit tests to verify that the new "Timezone" field correctly populates based on the state.
Perform integration tests to ensure that all systems using the address information handle the new "Timezone" field correctly.
Documentation

Update all relevant system and user documentation to reflect the addition of the "Timezone" field.
Rollback Plan

Develop a rollback plan in case of implementation failure.
