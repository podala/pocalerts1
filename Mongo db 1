When designing the other tables mentioned in the diagram for MongoDB, the decision to use individual collections, embedding, or references depends on the relationships between the data, the query patterns, and the specific use cases. Here's a breakdown of how each table can be designed:

1. P&L Standard (PLStandard) Collection
Design Choice: Individual Collection
Reason: PLStandard represents a master data entity, which might be referenced by other collections (e.g., UNV_Map). Keeping it as a separate collection allows for easy management, updates, and potential reuse across other collections.
Schema:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "Dir_ID": "...",
  "Name": "...",
  "CreatedBy": "...",
  "CreationDate": ISODate("..."),
  "LastUpdated": ISODate("..."),
  "IsActive": true
}
2. Header Collection
Design Choice: Individual Collection
Reason: Similar to PLStandard, Header is also a master data entity that could be referenced by other collections, making it a good candidate for its own collection.
Schema:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "Head_ID": "...",
  "Name": "...",
  "CreatedBy": "...",
  "CreationDate": ISODate("..."),
  "LastUpdated": ISODate("..."),
  "IsActive": true
}
3. Channel Collection
Design Choice: Individual Collection
Reason: Channel could be referenced by multiple entities (e.g., UNV_Map), and keeping it separate allows for flexible management and updates.
Schema:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "Chan_ID": "...",
  "Name": "...",
  "CreatedBy": "...",
  "CreationDate": ISODate("..."),
  "LastUpdated": ISODate("..."),
  "IsActive": true
}
4. BrandName Collection
Design Choice: Individual Collection
Reason: Like the other master data entities, BrandName should be its own collection to facilitate easy referencing and updates.
Schema:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "B_ID": "...",
  "Name": "...",
  "CreatedBy": "...",
  "CreationDate": ISODate("..."),
  "LastUpdated": ISODate("..."),
  "IsActive": true
}
5. SimPOS Collection
Design Choice: Individual Collection
Reason: As with other master data entities, keeping SimPOS separate allows for straightforward referencing and updates.
Schema:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "S_ID": "...",
  "Name": "...",
  "CreatedBy": "...",
  "CreationDate": ISODate("..."),
  "LastUpdated": ISODate("..."),
  "IsActive": true
}
6. PLRun Collection
Design Choice: Individual Collection
Reason: PLRun represents a specific run or instance and may have many relationships with other entities. It's best to keep it as an individual collection for better management.
Schema:
json
Copy code
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "PLVersion": "...",
  "PLID": "...",
  "PLRunDate": ISODate("..."),
  "PLRunRepositoryLocation": "..."
}
