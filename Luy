I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure alignment and accuracy within our song fields derived from the SFGO canonical model, I am reaching out to request a review and further input on the fields in our current structure. This initiative is crucial to meet our data consistency standards and ensure optimal integration.

Current Status:
We have identified and included the primary fields required for our song model. However, to finalize the model, we need to confirm a few details with Dawn to validate certain fields and gain insight on additional fields that may be essential from the canonical model perspective.

Request for Action:
Field Confirmation: We aim to finalize the fields based on a discussion with Dawn. This will allow us to verify if our current field selection aligns with SFGOâ€™s standards.
Additional Input: There are specific fields that may require additional input from Dawn. Gathering this input will enable us to ensure our model is comprehensive and adheres to the canonical specifications.
Next Steps:
Could you please facilitate this review by coordinating a session with Dawn? Alternatively, if there are any other stakeholders who might offer valuable insight, kindly let us know. We appreciate your support in helping us finalize this component.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your continued support in maintaining data excellence across our models.
