Current API-Based (Point-to-Point) Architecture Challenges 1️⃣ High Dependency Between Applications

One system failure affects others, causing delays.
2️⃣ Long Deployment & Downtime Risks
API integrations require synchronized deployments, leading to 8-12 hours of effort.
3️⃣ High API Costs
Token generation, authentication, and API call charges add significant operational costs.
4️⃣ Data Loss & Manual Recovery
If an API call fails, data is lost unless manually retried.
5️⃣ Limited Scalability
Adding new applications increases complexity, requiring custom integrations per API.
🚀 Solution: Event-Driven Architecture
🔄 Decouples Applications → Systems process events independently, reducing failures.
🚀 Faster Deployments → No need for synchronized updates; reduces downtime.
🔌 Lower API Costs → No token management, reduced API gateway dependency.
🔄 Built-in Retries & Guaranteed Delivery → Eliminates manual recovery efforts.
📈 Scales Easily → New services can subscribe to events without impacting existing systems.

📊 Cost & Time Comparison
Factor	Point-to-Point (API-Based) 💰	Event-Driven (Event Hub/Kafka) 🚀	Savings 💡
API Token Costs	Requires token validation (~$X/month)	No token authentication required	100% savings
API Call Charges	Pay-per-call pricing (~$Y/month)	Charged per event processing, not per call (~40-60% cheaper)	40-60% savings
Deployment Time & Effort	8-12 hours for coordinated deployment	2-4 hours, independent updates	~60% time saved
Infrastructure Costs	API Gateway & Load Balancer (~$A/month)	Event Hub (~$B/month)	If B < A, cost savings achieved
Maintenance Costs	API versioning, debugging (~$C/month)	No endpoint maintenance (~$D/month)	30-50% less maintenance effort
Data Recovery Costs	Manual effort for failed transactions (~$G/month)	Automatic retries prevent data loss	100% savings on recovery costs
💡 Business Takeaway
✅ Lower API & Operational Costs
✅ Faster Deployments & Independent Scaling
✅ No More Data Loss or Manual Recovery
✅ Future-Proofing Business with Scalable Architecture

🎯 Moving to an event-driven architecture will save costs, improve efficiency, and ensure long-term scalability!
