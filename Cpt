Business is asking bsnefit for storing the data at two places vs storing data at one place also one application sending data and other application modify and saving data at their end .here the point they are not sending updates back to source system . From architecture side we raised concern that source should get all updates and source system will provide update service to them . Also here catch is under writer has to go and upload all the files again on what they updated in another application. Here once we store the data at source system we can variance report and identify whether uw uploaded the file again or not . Please create business Benefit and also cost will save interms of data storage

Hereâ€™s a structured document outlining the business benefits and cost savings of storing data in one place versus storing it in multiple places, along with the architectural recommendation for maintaining data integrity and efficiency.

Business Benefits and Cost Savings of Storing Data in One Place vs. Two Places
Current Challenge
One application sends data, while another application modifies and saves it on their end without sending updates back to the source system.
Underwriters are required to re-upload all modified files to the source system manually.
This creates data inconsistency, redundancy, and potential gaps in tracking updates.
Lack of a unified update mechanism leads to increased operational overhead, potential compliance risks, and additional storage costs.
Business Benefits of Storing Data in One Place (Centralized Storage Approach)
1. Data Integrity & Single Source of Truth
Ensures all updates are captured in the source system, maintaining data consistency across applications.
Eliminates the risk of data drift where the modified version exists only in one application.
The source system can provide an update service to sync changes efficiently across applications.
2. Automation & Process Optimization
Variance reports can be generated to track if underwriters have re-uploaded modified files.
Instead of relying on manual uploads, an automated tracking system can be implemented to flag missing updates.
Reduces the risk of errors caused by manual interventions.
3. Reduced Storage & Cost Savings
Storing the data twice (source and target application) increases redundant storage costs.
If the modified data is synced back to the source, duplicate storage is avoided, leading to cost savings on cloud or on-premise infrastructure.
Cost Reduction Estimation: If each file is stored twice and takes X GB per file, this results in double the storage cost. A centralized storage model can cut costs by up to 50%.
4. Improved Audit & Compliance
Regulatory and compliance needs require a full audit trail of changes.
If the modified data is not sent back to the source system, compliance risks arise, especially in highly regulated industries.
A single-source system ensures auditability, meeting compliance requirements with ease.
5. Enhanced Underwriter Experience & Productivity
Underwriters currently re-upload modified files manually, which is inefficient.
Storing updates in the source system eliminates duplicate efforts, improving efficiency and reducing manual workload.
A self-service mechanism can be built for underwriters to validate modifications instead of re-uploading files.
Cost Savings of Storing Data in One Place
Cost Factor	Storing in Two Places	Storing in One Place (Centralized)	Savings %
Data Storage Cost	2X (Duplicate Storage)	1X (Single Source of Truth)	~50%
Manual Re-Uploads	High (Underwriters Upload Again)	Low (Automated Variance Tracking)	~30-40%
Compliance & Audit Risks	High	Low (One System Maintains Full Updates)	Avoiding Fines
Data Consistency & Sync	Manual Efforts Needed	Automated Sync via Update Service	~50%
Recommendation (Centralized Update Approach)
The source system should always receive updates from the modifying application.
A service-based update mechanism should be introduced where the modifying application sends changes back to the source in real time.
The source system will then:
Generate a variance report to identify if underwriters re-uploaded modified files.
Enable automated validation to check discrepancies and avoid unnecessary re-uploads.
This eliminates manual intervention, reduces duplicate storage, ensures compliance, and improves overall operational efficiency.
Conclusion
Storing data at one place (centralized) provides clear business benefits: reduced storage costs, improved data integrity, compliance assurance, and better underwriter productivity.
A structured update mechanism ensures that all modifications flow back to the source, preventing manual uploads and tracking data efficiently.
By adopting this approach, costs will be reduced by nearly 50%, and business processes will become more efficient with enhanced tracking and automation.
