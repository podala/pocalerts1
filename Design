That's a sensible approach. Notifying the user before flipping the task ensures better user experience and avoids potential confusion. Here's how you can implement it:

1. Client-Side Reminder:
a) When a user sets a task to "in-progress", start a client-side timer using JavaScript. You can use the setTimeout function to trigger an event after a set period, let's say, 1 hour 50 minutes (10 minutes before the 2-hour mark).

b) When the timer event triggers, display a notification to the user (this can be a modal, popup, browser notification, etc.), asking them if they are still working on the task.

c) If the user confirms they're still working on it, you can reset the client-side timer or allow for an extended grace period. If the user chooses to release the task or does not respond within a certain timeframe, you can proceed with flipping the status. This action will require a server call, but only when necessary.

2. Server-Side Action:
When the client decides to flip the status or if there's no response after the notification, you'll need to inform the server to update the task's status.

a) Send an AJAX request (or fetch API call) from the client-side to the server, updating the task status to "scheduled" and resetting the in_progress_timestamp.

b) If the client-side fails to send an update (maybe due to a browser/tab closure or connectivity issue), you still might want a server-side fallback. This can be a scheduled task that checks tasks in the "in-progress" state for more than 2 hours. Since the client-side is handling most notifications, this server-side check will happen less frequently, thereby reducing the database calls.

3. Optional â€“ Websockets:
If your application uses websockets (e.g., through technologies like Socket.io or WebSockets in general), you can establish real-time communication between the server and the client. This would allow the server to directly push a notification to the user when the 2-hour mark is approaching and also receive a real-time response.

Key Benefits:
User-Centric: Notifying the user before taking action on their tasks makes the system more user-friendly and reduces the chance of unexpected behaviors.

Reduced Server Load: By handling the notification and user confirmation on the client-side, you significantly reduce unnecessary server calls.

Flexibility: Providing an option to extend the "in-progress" state (if the user is still working on it) can be beneficial for tasks that might genuinely take longer than expected.

Remember, the goal is to strike a balance between efficient system operations and a smooth user experience. This approach seems to lean into achieving both.
