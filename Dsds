I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out to discuss a matter that has recently come to my attention concerning role visibility within our [system/organization/team].

It's come to my notice that certain individuals may have access or visibility to roles that they shouldn't. This not only presents potential security and confidentiality risks but could also lead to confusion and inefficiencies in our operations.

I kindly request that we review the current role assignments and visibility settings to ensure that each team member can only see the roles that are pertinent to their position and tasks. It would be in our best interest to address this issue proactively, safeguarding our processes and data integrity.

Please let me know if there are any technical or procedural challenges in implementing this change. I believe that by doing so, we will be enhancing our operational security and maintaining the clarity of roles and responsibilities.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

Warm regards,
