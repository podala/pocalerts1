| **Fixed Token**                | Split every N tokens                             | Simple docs            | Breaks sentences       | Low maturity systems       |
| **Sliding Window**             | Fixed size + overlap                             | RAG Q&A                | Storage increase       | Non-contextual embeddings  |
| **Recursive Chunking**         | Split by paragraph → sentence → token if too big | Mixed structure docs   | Slight complexity      | General enterprise default |
| **Structural (Heading-Based)** | Split by headings/sections                       | Reports, RFP, Sales    | Uneven chunk size      | Most enterprise documents  |
| **Clause-Based**               | Split by legal numbering                         | Contracts, Regulations | Needs regex rules      | Legal systems              |
| **Semantic Boundary**          | Split when topic changes (embedding similarity)  | Whitepapers            | Heavy compute          | Research systems           |
| **Hierarchical Chunking**      | Multi-level parent-child chunks                  | Long complex docs      | Requires metadata mgmt | Advanced enterprise        |
| **Contextual Chunking**        | Use voyage-context-3 to encode global context    | Large multi-topic docs | Model cost             | High-quality RAG           |
