Integrate claims data and EHR data from PBM databases into the AI model.

2. AI Model Prediction	Run predictive models on patient data to forecast upcoming medication needs.	Generate a list of patients likely to require new medications in the near future.
3. Internal Review (Underwriter/Pharmacist)	Share AI predictions with underwriters and clinical pharmacists.	Underwriters/pharmacists review AI suggestions and prepare for formulary adjustments if needed.
4. Client Communication	Provide clients with AI-generated reports detailing predicted medication needs and potential cost impacts.	Clients are informed proactively about upcoming medication demands and possible formulary updates.
5. RFP/RFI Resubmission (If Needed)	If the predicted medication needs significantly alter costs, trigger a repricing request or a new RFP/RFI.	The PBM resubmits updated pricing or formulary proposals to the client.
6. Repricing Analysis	AI-assisted repricing analysis based on new formulary structure and predicted usage.	Ensure competitive pricing and align formulary with patient needs and client budget constraints.
7. Client Approval	After review, clients approve or request modifications to the updated formulary.	Once approved, the PBM updates the system and onboards new medications into the pharmacy benefit plans.
8. Continuous Monitoring	Post-integration, continue using AI to monitor medication usage and adherence.	Adjust formulary and pricing dynamically based on real-time data and patient outcomes.
