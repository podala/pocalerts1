Your system owns the master data, and you're providing microservices to other applications for updating and viewing this data. To avoid data duplication and maintain centralized data management, the updates from external systems are not directly applied to the core tables. Instead, updates are captured in a separate table, and reconciliation is done between the core table and this new table. If a user misses updating the data through file ingestion, they have an option to re-ingest the file with the latest changes.
