Why Change? (Current Challenges)
⏳ Long Deployment Hours – Teams need to sync multiple systems.
🔗 High Dependency Between Applications – One failure impacts others.
❌ Risk of Data Loss – No built-in retries.
⚙️ Manual Effort & Debugging – Slow issue resolution.
✅ The Solution: Event-Driven Approach (Kafka/Event Hub)
📌 Decouples Applications – Systems process independently.
🔄 In-Built Retries – No data loss even if a system is down.
🚀 Faster Deployments – Teams deploy independently, reducing downtime.
📉 Lower Operational Effort – Less debugging, fewer bottlenecks.
📊 Impact & Savings
Task	Before	After (Event-Driven)	Time Saved
Deployments	8-12 hrs	2-4 hrs	⏬ 60%
Data Recovery	5-6 hrs	Automatic	⏬ 100%
Issue Debugging	3-4 hrs	Minimal	⏬ 70%
Integration Testing	2-3 days	1 day	⏬ 50%
🚀 Key Takeaway
✅ Independent Deployments 🔄 No Data Loss 🚀 Faster & Scalable
🔗 Fewer Dependencies 🛠️ Lower Operational Overhead

→ Business moves faster, with higher reliability & efficiency!

For design:

Use icons (⚡, 🔄, ✅) to make it visually appealing.
Use a simple, bold font (e.g., Montserrat, Arial).
Keep one key message per section for clarity.

1️⃣ Explain the Hidden Costs of the Current Architecture
Current Setup: Point-to-Point Communication

Works fine for now, but as we scale, dependencies will increase.
Each system is directly tied to others, meaning:
More maintenance overhead.
More manual coordination during deployments.
More downtime risks when one system fails.
🚨 "We don’t have issues today, but will this scale when we onboard more clients, add new use cases, or integrate with more systems?"

2️⃣ Show the Business Value of an Event-Driven Model
Current (Point-to-Point)	Proposed (Event-Driven)
High Dependency – If one system fails, others may fail.	Loose Coupling – Systems process independently.
Harder Deployments – Teams need to coordinate & deploy together.	Independent Deployments – No need to sync all services.
Scalability Issues – Adding new systems increases complexity.	Easier Scaling – Just subscribe new services to events.
No Built-in Retry – If a system fails, data may be lost.	Guaranteed Delivery – Data is stored & retried automatically.
More Debugging Needed – Failures are harder to track.	Better Observability – Logs & event tracking simplify monitoring.
🚀 "This shift isn’t just about fixing problems – it’s about future-proofing the business."

3️⃣ Use a Real-World Example (Resonates with Business)
Imagine an e-commerce platform:

A point-to-point system means the order service calls the payment service, which calls the shipping service.

If payment fails, the order is stuck, requiring manual fixes.
Deploying changes to one system requires all services to be updated together.
An event-driven system means:

The order service just publishes an event (“Order Placed”).
Other services consume it at their own pace (e.g., Payment, Inventory, and Shipping).
Failures don’t block the entire process – failed events are retried automatically.
✅ Faster response times, fewer failures, and more business agility.

4️⃣ Address the Business’s Concerns (Objections & Responses)
Business Concern	Your Response
“We don’t have data loss today.”	But what happens when a system is down? Event-driven guarantees no data loss with retries.
“Deployments are working fine.”	Teams spend long hours coordinating—this will allow independent deployments.
“We can manage dependencies manually.”	But as we scale, manual work increases exponentially. This architecture automates it.
“This is a big change. Why now?”	Scaling requires a foundation. Waiting until failures happen will cost more later.
🔑 "By adopting event-driven architecture now, we reduce future risks, improve efficiency, and ensure smooth growth."

5️⃣ Highlight Cost & Time Savings
📌 Current Deployments:

Each team must coordinate changes.
Any failure rolls back everything.
8-12 hours of deployment effort.
✅ Event-Driven Deployments:

Independent updates – no downtime for others.
2-4 hours max – 60% time saved.
📌 Current Issue Handling:

Debugging failures takes hours.
Manually fixing stuck processes.
✅ Event-Driven Reliability:

Automatic retries prevent failures.
Faster issue resolution = higher business continuity.
💰 Outcome: Reduced downtime, fewer incidents, and more agile business operations.

6️⃣ Summarize the Business Impact in One Slide
🚀 Moving to Event-Driven Architecture: Why Now? ✅ Independent Deployments → No long hours spent coordinating.
✅ No More Data Loss → Guaranteed delivery with built-in retries.
✅ Scalability for Growth → Add new services easily without rewriting code.
✅ Lower Maintenance Costs → Fewer dependencies = fewer failures.

"We don’t have issues now, but growth brings complexity. This shift ensures we stay ahead while reducing future risks."
