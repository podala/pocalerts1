Hi Jerin,

As discussed, we are providing data to the CPM team, which is currently agreed to be read-only. However, the concern is that Underwriters (UW) can modify data from CPM, and the data store is CPM-owned.

Key Concerns:
Data Storage & Ownership:

PL does not want CPM to store P&L data due to potential data mismatches between PL databases and downstream dependencies.
Versioning & Data Consistency:

PL has the capability to store data on a version basis, ensuring that even if an underwriter modifies the data, versioning can be maintained on the PL side.
This approach helps preserve historical changes and ensures consistency across systems.
Integration & Responsibility:

In my view, PNL can provide components to CPM, and CPM should only integrate them without modifying the data.
Even if an underwriter makes changes, PNL should take ownership of managing the data integrity.
PL as a Microproduct:

We envision PNL as a Microproduct responsible for:
Creating new MAP variables
Managing data updates
Handling data correction activities
Proposed Solution:
CPM should only integrate the components provided by PNL instead of modifying or storing PNL data.
PL should maintain versioned data storage to track underwriter changes without causing discrepancies in downstream systems.
Let me know your thoughts on this approach.
